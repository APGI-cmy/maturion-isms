# BUILD PROGRESS TRACKER

**Module**: PIT (Project Implementation Tracker)  
**Module Slug**: pit  
**Last Updated**: 2026-05-06  
**Updated By**: foreman-v2-agent (wave: pit-stage1-cs2-approval-stage2-initiation — maturion-isms#1540)

> **Classification**: ACTIVE — RETROFIT NOW  
> **Canon Reference**: `PRE_BUILD_STAGE_MODEL_CANON.md` v1.0.0 (effective 2026-04-05)  
> **Issue**: [maturion-isms#1255](https://github.com/APGI-cmy/maturion-isms/issues/1255)

## Stage Migration Note

This tracker was migrated from the legacy 6-stage format to the canonical 12-stage format
per wave `align-12stage-prebuild-20260406` (2026-04-06).

**Anomaly Flagged**: The `00-app-description/` folder is empty (no `app-description.md` found),
yet Architecture contains extensive work (one of the most complete architectures outside MAT):
`architecture.md`, `data-contracts/`, `exports/`, `integrations/`, `qa/`, `ui-ux/`, `watchdog/`,
`_legacy/`. App Description must be created before this module can proceed through the canonical
stage sequence. The existing Architecture work is valuable and will be preserved.

**Old → New Stage Mapping**:
| Old Stage | Old Name | New Stage | New Name | Status |
|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Stage 0 | App Description | Stage 1 | App Description | DRAFT_PENDING_CS2_APPROVAL |
| Stage 1 | FRS | Stage 3 | FRS | NOT_STARTED (folder empty) |
| Stage 1.5 | TRS | Stage 4 | TRS | NOT_STARTED |
| Stage 2 | Architecture | Stage 5 | Architecture | IN_PROGRESS |
| Stage 3 | Implementation Plan | Stage 8 | Implementation Plan | NOT_STARTED |

## Current Stage Summary

**Current Stage**: Stage 2 ACTIVE — UX Workflow & Wiring Spec initiated (maturion-isms#1540)  
**Overall Progress**: ~20% complete (Stage 1 App Description approved; Stage 2 initiated; Architecture substantially IN_PROGRESS)  
**Blockers**: None for Stage 2. Build Authorization NOT CLEARED — implementation blocked until Stages 2–11 completed and gate-passed.  
**Next Steps**:
1. Complete Stage 2 (UX Workflow & Wiring Spec) — `modules/pit/01-ux-workflow-wiring-spec/ux-workflow-wiring-spec.md`
2. Complete Stage 3 (FRS) building on App Description + UX Workflow
3. Complete Stage 4 (TRS)
4. Formally gate-pass Stage 5 (Architecture — rich content already exists, needs approval)
5. Complete Stages 6–11 before Build Authorization can be requested

**MMM-Derived Learning Controls (Carry-Forward)**:
PIT carries forward 8 build-process improvement controls from the MMM module build. These are
documented in the App Description (§ MMM Lessons Promoted Into PIT) and the improvement register:
`modules/pit/_readiness/pit-build-process-improvement-register.md`
- L-001: L1/L2/L3 closure model (build-complete ≠ operationally closed)
- L-002: UI rendering completeness (global styles, app shell) must be tested
- L-003: Post-login pages require all 5 states (loading/empty/permission-denied/network-error/data)
- L-004: Auth route discoverability must be designed up front in Stage 2
- L-005: Tests must prove runtime/UI behaviour, not only file existence
- L-006: Deployment execution must be a first-class contract (filed before PBFAG)
- L-007: Operational closure requires live evidence (L3 = CS2 verified live E2E)
- L-008: Continuous improvement must be recorded in the improvement register

## Notes and Observations

**Stage 1 App Description Filed (2026-05-06)**: App Description v1.0-draft created per
maturion-isms#1534 delegation from Foreman to pit-specialist. Module name corrected from
"Penetration Intelligence Tool" to "Project Implementation Tracker". Source prepared by
CS2/Johan + assistant-assisted drafting under Johan Ras direction. MMM Lessons Promoted Into PIT
section added (L-001–L-008 + Stage 2 carry-forward requirements).
Improvement register created at `modules/pit/_readiness/pit-build-process-improvement-register.md`.

**Stage 1 App Description CS2 Approved (2026-05-06)**: CS2/Johan Ras reviewed and approved Stage 1
App Description per maturion-isms#1540. Status changed from Draft to Authoritative (v1.0). Stage 2
(UX Workflow & Wiring Spec) authorised. Build Authorization remains NOT CLEARED — implementation
blocked until Stages 2–11 completed and gate-passed.

**Governance Upgrade (2026-04-06)**: Stage model migrated from legacy 6-stage (Stage 0–5) to
canonical 12-stage per `PRE_BUILD_STAGE_MODEL_CANON.md` v1.0.0. See Stage Migration Note above.

**Prior Note (2026-02-13)**: TRS stage introduced per governance upgrade "Governance Upgrade:
Insert Technical Requirements Specification (TRS) Step".

**PIT Integration Contract**: `PIT_INTEGRATION_CONTRACT_v0.1.md` exists in the module root and
provides useful context for App Description authoring.

**AI Integration**: AIMC wiring (Wave 9.7) complete. `pit-advisor.md` persona delivered.
See `10-governance-notes/` and `20-ai/` for AI integration governance context.
