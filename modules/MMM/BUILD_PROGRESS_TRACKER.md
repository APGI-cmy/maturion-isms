# BUILD PROGRESS TRACKER

**Module**: MMM (Maturity Management Module)  
**Module Slug**: MMM  
**Last Updated**: 2026-04-06

> **Classification**: ACTIVE — RETROFIT NOW  
> **Canon Reference**: `PRE_BUILD_STAGE_MODEL_CANON.md` v1.0.0 (effective 2026-04-05)

## Stage Migration Note

This tracker was migrated from the legacy 6-stage format to the canonical 12-stage format
per wave `align-12stage-prebuild-20260406` (2026-04-06).

**Anomaly Corrected**: The previous version of this tracker incorrectly referenced "Risk
Management" as the module name and `risk-management` as the module slug. This was a copy-paste
error from the original governance layer-down. The module is MMM (Maturity Model Management).

**Old → New Stage Mapping**:
| Old Stage | Old Name | New Stage | New Name | Status |
|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Stage 0 | App Description | Stage 1 | App Description | COMPLETE |
| Stage 1 | FRS | Stage 3 | FRS | NOT_STARTED (folder empty) |
| Stage 1.5 | TRS | Stage 4 | TRS | NOT_STARTED |
| Stage 2 | Architecture | Stage 5 | Architecture | IN_PROGRESS |
| Stage 3 | Implementation Plan | Stage 8 | Implementation Plan | NOT_STARTED |
| Stage 4 | Builder Appointment | Stage 11 | Builder Appointment | NOT_STARTED |
| Stage 5 | Build | Stage 12 | Build | NOT_STARTED (partial AIMC artifact) |

#### 12.1 Critical Deliverable Validation (Waves 5-7 Lessons)

**Frontend Application Deliverables** (if UI required):
- [ ] React app (or framework) exists at documented path
- [ ] App launches successfully in development mode
- [ ] Production build succeeds without errors
- [ ] App deployed to staging/production environment
- [ ] Deployment URL accessible and functional
- [ ] UI components render correctly
- [ ] Routing works (if multi-page app)

**Backend Application Deliverables** (if backend required):
- [ ] API server code exists at documented path
- [ ] API server starts successfully
- [ ] Database schema deployed
- [ ] Database seeded with test data
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] API deployed to staging/production
- [ ] API URL accessible and functional

**UI-to-Backend Wiring Validation** (MANDATORY if both exist):
- [ ] Frontend can successfully call backend API
- [ ] Authentication/authorization flow works
- [ ] Data flows from UI → API → Database → API → UI
- [ ] Error handling works (backend errors shown in UI)
- [ ] CORS configured correctly (no browser errors)
- [ ] E2E tests covering full workflows PASSING

**Infrastructure Deployment Evidence** (REQUIRED):
- [ ] Frontend deployment URL documented and accessible
- [ ] Backend deployment URL documented and accessible
- [ ] Database connection string configured (secrets secured)
- [ ] Environment variables configured in deployment platforms
- [ ] Health check endpoints verified
- [ ] At least ONE complete workflow demonstrated with screenshots/video

**Prohibition - Wave Closure WITHOUT**:
- ❌ Frontend deployment (if UI specified in requirements)
- ❌ Backend deployment (if API specified in requirements)
- ❌ Database deployment (if data persistence required)
- ❌ Working E2E workflow demonstration
- ❌ UI wiring tests (if both UI and backend exist)

**Completion Date**: N/A  
**Notes**: Core build not yet started. However, as an artifact of Wave 9.6 AIMC integration
(pre-12-stage), `src/services/aimc-wiring.ts` exists as an AIMC integration component.
This is an integration artifact, not a core module build deliverable. Mapped from old Stage 5.

## Current Stage Summary

**Current Stage**: Stage 1 COMPLETE — Stage 2 (UX Workflow & Wiring Spec) next  
**Overall Progress**: ~10% complete (Stage 1 done; Stages 2–12 not started)  
**Blockers**: None currently blocking — Stage 2 (UX Workflow & Wiring Spec) awaits CS2 wave-start  
**Next Steps**:
1. Develop Stage 2 (UX Workflow & Wiring Spec) for MMM
2. Develop Stage 3 (FRS) after Stage 2 complete
3. Complete Stage 4 (TRS) after FRS
4. Formalise Stage 5 (Architecture) approval after TRS complete

## Governance Compliance

- [ ] All stages proceeding in order (no skipped stages)
- [ ] Traceability maintained (App Description → UX Workflow → FRS → TRS → Architecture)
- [ ] All required approvals obtained
- [ ] Evidence artifacts created for each stage
- [ ] Module manifest up to date

## Notes and Observations

**Tracker Anomaly Corrected (2026-04-06)**: Previous version of this tracker incorrectly referenced
"Risk Management" module. The error originated from the initial governance layer-down when MMM
module structure was created. Corrected in wave `align-12stage-prebuild-20260406`.

**Governance Upgrade (2026-04-06)**: Stage model migrated from legacy 6-stage (Stage 0–5) to
canonical 12-stage per `PRE_BUILD_STAGE_MODEL_CANON.md` v1.0.0. See Stage Migration Note above.

**MMM Strategy**: MMM (`MMM_strategy.md`) defines the convergence of MAT, Maturity Roadmap, and
legacy maturity capabilities into a single Maturity Model Management product. Strategy is in
DRAFT status pending CS2 review and canonisation.
