Overview\
Diamonds are a highly compressed store of value, are difficult to trace
and are easily transported and traded; as such they are highly
desirable. This desire for diamonds is the foundation of our business,
however, it can also attract illicit traders, artisanal miners, and
criminals to our operations. Not only can people with malicious intent
steal diamonds but they can also look to access, extract, and exploit
sensitive and confidential information the various Lucara Systems.\
Before a single diamond can be recovered, huge amounts of waste need to
be removed and extensive tonnage o f diamond bearing ore must be
processed. Financially viable diamond recovery is based on the number of
diamonds, expressed as carats that can be recovered per 100 tons of
diamond bearing ore. The processing of diamond bearing ore proves to be
extremely exp ensive, and therefore diamonds lost because of theft,
inefficient recovery, or diamond processing, i.e., the breaking of
diamonds, will have a negative impact on the profitability of the
organisation.\
This framework document provides specific mandatory direction and
recommended guidance on coordinating Lucara Diamond security activities
to protect our people, product, profits, reputation, and information
from both malicious as well as non -malicious loss.

Protection Group Inc. 2021 The Business Purpose and Context Business
Purpose\
Lucara Botswana finds, mines, markets and sells diamonds. These
activities require us to establish and maintain our social licence to
operate through working with local communities and governments and
ultimately communicating the rarity and value of diamo nds with
consumers.\
Diamonds are rare, highly desirable, valuable, easily transportable and
tradable. This combination of features can attract illicit traders,
artisanal miners, and criminals to our operations. We recognise these
pose specific risks to our business that need detailed and coordinated
internal controls.\
This document provi des a framework to coordinate these controls and
details minimum performance standards. It has been written utilising a
wide body of expertise from the diamond and precious metals sectors.\
It consists of this preamble, the Standard itself and then 25 det ailed
Minimum Performance Standards ('MPS'). Each of the MPS starts with a
statement of intent. Leaders should seek to achieve the intent and meet
or exceed the performance standards to achieve effective Loss Prevention
and Security in their areas. The o bjectives of this Diamond Control
Standard are to:\
•Create an environment where business leaders at all levels understand
the intent behind the Diamond Control Standard in their areas and
champion their implementation . •Develop a positive culture at Lucara
Botswana businesses where teams have a broadunderstanding of the need
for reliable people trained for their roles and understanding
theirobligations, process integrity and security, along with effective
governance and assurance . •Outline a risk -based appr oach to Security
activities . •Provide a clear statement that criminal, fraudulent,
corrupt or improper conduct is not acceptable and ensure that
appropriate action is taken if it is found . •Detail procedures and
actions to be taken . •Measure Security effectiveness so that it can be
managed accordingly by the operation's generalmanager. \_\_\_\_

Context -- Threats and Risks\
The threat of illegal artisanal miners, illicit traders, corrupt
officials and criminals to our operations is likely to be high. These
threats can often manifest themselves through Lucara Botswana personnel
using their detailed u nderstanding of the process of finding,
recovering, sorting and selling diamonds to subvert internal controls
and steal the product.\
Significant potential threats to our operations and how they might
manifest are:

The Decision to Steal\
Theft or fraud by employees is a significant threat to Lucara
operations. In assessing this and possible countermeasures we consider
the factors influencing an individual's decision to steal, which is
based on rational decision making that considers the (perceived):\
• Opportunity to steal -- people are tempted by opportunities over time\
• Assessment of the risk of b eing caught and the likely reward\
• Ease of stealing\
• Likely punishment should they be caught\
• Ability to neutralise moral concerns\
The internal control framework adopted by Lucara businesses needs to
influence the employees' perceptions of all these conside rations in the
business' favour. Security measures should be assessed considering the
implications of this model.\
A primer on Security is at Annex A for those readers that are not
familiar with security concepts. Significant Threats Manifest as Risks
That\
Artisanal and Illegal Miners on concession areas undermine our social
license to operate, remove diamonds, reduce profits and potentially
create investor and public relations issues\
Theft by robbery and/or extortion by outsiders endanger our personnel,
undermine our controls, steal diamonds, reduce profits, potentially crea
te public relations issues\
Insider theft by personnel endanger our personnel, undermine our
controls, steal diamonds and reduce profits\
Theft assisted by insiders endanger our personnel, undermine our
controls, steal diamonds, undermine the operation's leadership, and
reduce profits

The Diamond Control Standard\
Scope\
All operations and functions in Lucara Botswana will comply with this
standard. All Lucara Botswana Group personnel, as well as those
employees of its subsidiary businesses, will comply with the MPS that
apply to them. Failur e to comply may result in discipline up to and
including termination of employment or contract.\
If there is a conflict between these standards and applicable local law,
Lucara Botswana will comply with the local law and if appropriate with
the one that is more stringent in the context.\
Guidance\
Diamond handling businesses in which a Lucara Botswana has an interest
should be aware of this standard and be requested to adopt substantially
similar standards. This includes joint venture trading operations.\
Lucara Botswana exploration sites handling Diamonds are encouraged to
comply with this standard whe re appropriate and seek guidance from the
Lucara Botswana central functions on the application of diamond
controls.\
To the extent applicable, all service providers and suppliers are to
comply with this standard.\
Application\
This standard applies to all projects or operations at the following
stages:\
• Prefeasibility studies\
• Feasibility studies\
• Execution and construction\
• Commissioning and ramp up\
• Operating\
• Care and maintenance\
• Closure and rehabilitation\
Other stages of Lucara Botswana projects may be subjec t to this
standard at the discretion of the Managing Director, Lucara Botswana
(MD) and in consultation with each of the relevant boards.\
Newly acquired businesses or sites must perform a gap analysis of their
current security and security practices and th ose contained in this
standard and create an action plan for closing the gaps within six
months of their inclusion in the Lucara Botswana group. Within 18 months
of an acquisition, newly acquired businesses or sites must have
completed the implementation of the action plan and be compliant with
this standard and be confirmed as such by a duly appointed party to do
so by the company.\
Non -implementation and variance\
This standard deal specifically with diamond security at a mine site.
Many of the mandatory c lauses will be applicable across all operations.
Where inconsistencies are identified, the operation will be

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 8

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
responsible for formally submitting a non -implementation request to the
MD of Lucara Botswana. They will also be responsible for developing
controls appropriate to the risk in consultation with the Lucara
Botswana central functions and where applicable the CFO, Lucara
Diamond.\
Where a business recognises that it cannot currently conform to a
mandatory requirement or standard it may submit a variance request to
the MD of Lucara Botswana. A variance is an action plan that either puts
in place temporary controls to mitigate the risk or it details the
process the business is undertaking to obtain conformance.\
Supporting documents\
This standard refers to various supporting documents such as procedures.
Where such procedures are mentioned, adherence to them is mandatory and
subject to audit.\
Revision of this standard\
This standard will be formally reviewed and revised at least once every
two years. In the interim the MPS may be revised to consider learnings
from security and process failures or incidents. Any such revisions will
take the form of a formal memo from the MD to all operations citing the
clause(s) to be amended and the revised wording. All har d copies will
be amended accordingly.\
Audit of this standard\
External Audit:\
• A duly appointed external authority party will audit the
implementation of this standard in its entirety at each Lucara Botswana
site at least once every year and the results will be reported to the
Lucara Botswana MD, Lucara Diamond CFO and Board of Directors.\
• In addition, each site will be subject to an annual detailed technical
security audit as well as a cyber security audit against a recognised
standard such as ISO 17001.\
• At the discretion of the CFO or in response to serious concerns about
security, an operation may be audited against these standards more
frequently.\
• The audit report will result in prioritised recommendations, based on
risk, for improvements to mee t the standard.\
• The audit report will make a judgement about the operation's Security
based on the internal audit rating criteria shown below and an
appreciation of the maturity of the operation.\
Audit rating criteria\
The following table details the Lucara Botswana rating criteria that
will be used to assign a rating to the Security Audit findings. Issues
identified via the audit reports are each assigned ratings to determine
the issue's relative importance and potential impact on the
organisation. The ratings represent the inherent risk level and the
compliance to and effectiveness of controls to mitigate the risk for the
specific processes.

Figure 1: Lucara Botswana internal audit rating criteria\
Each issue identified will be rated in terms of compliance to this
standard in regard to Control Design i.e.:

A further assessment will be made in terms of the Control Effectiveness
and to what extent the control has matured in its implementation i.e.:\
CONTROL DESIGN DESCRIPTION\
INADEQUATE Internal controls do not exist or meet minimum acceptable
standards, because significant deficiencies exist, which could allow
material losses to take place and not be detected and managed on a
timely basis in the ordinary course of business.\
ADEQUATE Internal controls exist and meet acceptable standards and
provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the process covered
is reliable and material losses will be detected in the normal course of
business.

Minimum Performance Standards\
Security - A Whole Business Activity\
Security is a whole business activity; it cannot be delegated to the
security department alone. This is particularly the case with respect to
detecting and deterring insider theft.\
The 25 Minimum Performance Standards (MPS) are grouped into five main
components shown in the diagram below:\
Figure 2: Lucara Botswana structure pictorial

The house shaped diagram is instructive; the components are like
pillars, beams, roof and foundation, they are mutually supporting and
all need to be in place and in proportion to maintain the structural
integrity.\
Leadership and Governance\
Security leads directly to improved commercial results. As such, leaders
at all levels in Lucara Botswana operations must support it and know
their part in it. This has many benefits not least of which is that it
spreads the competence to identify and report wrongdoing beyond the
Diamond Control Committee to the wider workforce and other capable
managers. Refer to Annex B for key accountabilities for Security.\
The programme should be risk based with procedures and measures
proportionate to the risks faced. This will s erve to focus the effort
where it is most needed and will have the greatest impact for least
cost. Refer to Annex C for the risk criteria to use.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 11

Process Integrity\
The process of exploring, mining, processing, recovering, sorting,
grading and selling diamonds should have a high level of integrity and
be measured regularly throughout. This implies the use of a codified
management systems based on well- understood procedures across all
aspects of the business that will provide rigour and consistency in con
trol and allow effective performance management. The importance of
process integrity to eliminate operational failures and reduce
opportunities for theft cannot be overestimated and is shown in the
diagram below:\
Figure 3: Showing the importance of Process Integrity in preventing
losses1

People and Culture\
People choose to steal or to collude to allow theft or fraud to happen.
Influencing them is a central theme of Lucara Botswana' security
programme. It needs consistent business leadership to develop a positive
culture supporting the company.\
Externally Lucara Botswana' operations need the support of the local
community and government to effectively combat loss of diamonds to
artisanal miners and/or the illicit markets. T his support is vital
given the potential reputational damage that Lucara Botswana' handling
of these failures could cause to the wider equity value of Diamonds and
Lucara Botswana' share price.

Protection\
The Diamond Control Committee and security measures need to be capable,
credible and efficient.\
The protection will be risk based, use appropriate technology and be
resilient to failure. The organisational design of Lucara Botswana'
operations will be deliberate in creating the separation of duties.
Surveillance will be a central part of the protection design.\
Proof\
Management need verification that the security measures are working.
This could be done through mechanisms independent of site management to
avoid collusion and can involve building an understanding of the illicit
trade (locally and at the wholesale markets), establishing an employee
whistle blower line, lifestyle assessments and investigatio ns and off
-site surveillance review.\
Format of Minimum Performance Standards\
All MPS's are preceded by three statements, each time having the same
meaning:\
Intent: The reason why it is done, the aim or purpose behind doing it.\
Required Actions: These actions are mandatory and should be
implemented.\
Guidance: Guidance can be used to explain or outline further
considerations for best practice, it is not man datory. Where it is not
used, it is reserved for future clarifications and this is noted as
Guidance Reserved. Where operations would like more guidance, they
should request it so that it can be given in future versions.

Leadership and Governance\
MPS 1 -- Leadership\
Intent\
To set clear expectations for Security Management that are codified with
a policy and supporting procedures which are consistently applied by
leaders at all levels.\
Required Actions\
1.1 A Security Policy signed by the most senior executive for Lucara
Botswana - applicable to both Karowe Diamond Mine (KDM) and the
Corporate Office at the Diamond Technology Park (DTP) should be
prominently displayed. This display, subject to the location (at the
Corporate Office or KDM) should be either communicated via email and
placed on available and accessible social media platforms like Yammer.
For KDM, this should be placed for viewing by staff, contractors and
visitors on entry to the facility (Blue Gate at the Personnel Control
Centre/PCC) and on entry to the process plant and recovery building or
diamond handling area.\
1.2 The Security Policy will be a short document that will at least
outline the company's obligations and the individual's obligations
regarding Security and/or security related activities.\
1.3 The Policy will be incorporated into the operation's induction proce
ss for all personnel, contractors and visitors. A process will exist for
recording that all personnel, contractors and visitors understand and
agree to comply with it.\
1.4 The Heads of Department / HODs, Superintendents, etc. - leaders at
all levels - will endeavour to make the Security Policy relevant to
their place of operation / workplace.\
1.4.1 Through setting a limited number of Golden Rules that define
applicable security requirements based on the associated risk profile
and acceptable risk tolerance\
1.4.2 Through short awareness and training sessions on aspects of
Security conducted at least bi- weekly or as often as security incidents
and matters are brought to their attention.\
1.5 Where possible and applicable , specific Security accountabilities
and performance measures will be documented within role descriptions for
those in high -risk diamond areas, security and management.\
(Note: Within the current Performance Management Scorecard/System's and
approved Gener ic Objectives, reference is made to 'Security' and
'Governance' where KPA/Objectives and KPI/Measures are listed for those
in a HOD and/or Superintendent role. Consultation will need to be held
with HR to review any role descriptions for those in high- risk diamond
areas / Security / Management and determine if additional security
responsibilities are required to be included and/or enhanced)\
1.6 Leadership teams in high -risk diamond areas will regularly assess
the Security culture and adherence to security proto cols of their
workplaces. This is especially important during high risk / high
exposure activities that are undertaken during maintenance, shutdowns,
clearing of blockages/spillages, etc ., to name a few.

MPS 2 - Chain of Custody and Diamond Control Commi ttee Intent\
To provide clear accountability for the custody of diamond material from
the ore body to the point of onward shipping to the customer -- this is
the chain of custody.\
Required Actions\
2.1 The chain of custody for each operation will be set out in matrix
form, with an accountable manager named for each part of the chain and
any security or controls for which they are accountable listed
underneath their name. Do find annexed, Lucara Botswana's Chain of
Custody Matrix as Annex D.\
2.2 To indicate all accountable an d responsible people, the Chain of
Custody Matrix does list all those from the MD, GM to those in the
Mining Operations and Support Services, have been included in the chain
of custody where appropriate.\
2.3 The chain of custody document will be reviewed at least annually and
in the event of any personnel or process changes.\
2.4 The managers in the chain of custody will be accountable for the
effective delivery of Security in their area of control including the
safety and security of personnel, property, product an d reputation and
form the basis of the Diamond Control Committee (DCC).\
2.5 Security roles and responsibilities are to be clearly defined and
presented in the form of a RACI chart. Do find annexed, Lucara
Botswana's RACI Chart that outlines those accountable and responsible
for the Minimum Performance Standards as contained in the Lucara Diamond
Control Standard, as Annex E .\
2.6 The DCC, which will have responsibility for ensuring that an
effective Security programme is established and integrated into each
operat ion's work, will be chaired by the most senior executive of the
business or operation.\
2.7 The DCC will have a clear mandate and charter, do find annexed,
Lucara Botswana's Diamond Control Charter, as Annex E, endorsed by the
MD of Lucara Botswana and the most senior executive of the operation. As
a minimum this will include (but not be limited to):\
2.7.1 Developing and approving joint operations and security procedures
in high -risk areas,\
2.7.2 A focus on eliminating spillage, blockages or requirements for
unscheduled maintenance that provide opportunity for hands on exposure
to concentrated diamond product and identifying the root cause of each,\
2.7.3 Reviewing the human aspects of the teams working in high -risk
areas. Such reviews might look at the recruitment into the teams, the
quality of leadership, spans of control, quality of training, process
discipline and other aspects of workplace culture.\
2.7.4 Review data and product quality indicators as possible indicators
of loss.\
2.7.5 Providing guidance for Security inquiries and Serious Incident
Reviews, authorising and monitoring the implementation of the resulting
action plans\
2.7.6 Assessing incentive schemes and measures for their impact on
Security;

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 15

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
2.7.7 Reviewing security department policies and procedures and
performance against secur ity metrics,\
2.7.8 Review and approval of facility design changes for adequate
Security measures.\
2.8 The DCC will meet at least four times a year. Minutes will be taken
of these meetings, actions agreed, decisions recorded, and individuals
made accountable for the ir delivery.\
Guidance\
• The DCC is designed to be deliberately cross functional and an open
and transparent committee.\
• It is a change mechanism that will allow managers to hold their peers
to account and ask questions of performance.\
• Where possible it shou ld be aligned with other change initiatives at
the operation, particularly quality improvements, or interventions by
human resources.\
• Particularly important to include as chain of custody owners are the
process managers, Geologists, and the Risk Manager: S ecurity involved
in the high security risk areas of a business' operations.\
• Operations may spread the duties of the DCC between two tiers:\
o The Operation's DCC consisting of Heads of Department (HoD) or senior
managers meeting at least quarterly, and\
o Opera tional supervisors focused on the detail of Security in diamond
areas, the development of joint procedures and the management of change.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 16

MPS 3 - Separation of Duties\
Intent\
To reduce the risks of error and fraud by dividing or allocating tasks
among various individuals.\
Required Actions\
3.1 In handling and accounting for diamonds, operations will seek to
give a single individual responsibility for only one of the following
four components: custody of diamonds or diamond data, authorisations,
record keeping, and reconciliation. 2 This will be evident in the way
diamonds are handled and secured and how data on them is recorded and
stored.\
3.2 In the execution of security duties operat ions will seek to ensure
the separation of duties between Security Operations, Technical Security
Systems provisioning and Investigations. It is best practice to have
independent oversight and assurance over diamond handling activities and
technical security systems.\
3.3 The security function will be organisationally distinct from the
operational management of the diamond recovery or diamond handling
process. Currently, at Lucara Botswana, the Security Department operates
and reports separately from the operati onal management of the four
components as listed in 3.1 above.\
3.4 Security personnel will not be involved in the process or
operational management of diamond areas.\
3.5 Lucara Botswana will have a person designated as the 'Risk Manager:
Security (Security Manager)' who is responsible for security operations
at both Karowe Diamond Mine and Diamond Technology Park / DTP (Corporate
Office. The Risk Manager: Security is supported by the Karowe Mine
(upstream) Risk Co -Ordinator (Security Superintendent), the Gaborone
(downstream) Risk Co -Ordinator (Security Superintendent) and the Risk
Co -Ordinator Operational Support (both KDM and DTP).\
3.6 The Risk Manager: Security is the person who will be accountable for
the delivery of security at the operations (both KDM and DTP) and co
-ordination of security on behalf of the General Manager in accordance
with this standard, laws rules and regulations and applicable Lucara
Policies.\
3.7 The Risk Manager: Security will report independently and directly to
the most senior executive of th e operation. Currently, the Risk
Manager: Security reports direct to the Chief Risk Officer, who reports
to the Managing Director.\
3.8 The Risk Manager: Security will have regular interaction with the
most senior executive of the operation. This will be not less than twice
monthly.\
3.9 The Risk Manager: Security will support Heads of Department (HOD) /
Business Unit Managers in achieving Security in their areas through
enforcing the intent of this standard. Where a HOD wishes to deviate
from this standard the Risk Manager: Security Manager will escalate the
issue to the DCC or the General Manager or MD Lucara Botswana.\
3.10 The Risk Manager: Security will use me trics to improve security
effectiveness and report on performance against them to the DCC.

2 Based on COSO guidance for segregation of duties: www.coso.org

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 17

3.11 There will be a complete and current/ up -to-date security
procedures and post orders in place for all roles, as defined by the
review dates. These will be available for the security officers to
reference.\
3.12 Where the Risk Manager: Security has other roles, like that of
legally appointed Airport / Airstrip Manager (per the Civil Aviation
Authority of Botswana / CAAB), it is noted that majority of the time
should be spen t on Security issues.\
Guidance -- Reserved

MPS 4 - Risk Management\
Intent\
To ensure that we focus our efforts and resources on the greatest risks;
we identify, evaluate and control risks using a common Lucara Botswana
risk management approach, which is well understood. See guidance below .
Required Actions\
4.1 Lucara Botswana has formulated and adopted a Risk Management Policy
and Framework.\
4.2 The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) P olicy outlines Lucara
Botswana's risk management process and sets out the responsibilities of
the Board of Directors (the Board), the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC),
the Managing Director (MD), Executive Management and staff members
within the Company in relati on to risk management.

4.3 The ERM Policy should be read in conjunction with the Lucara
Botswana Enterprise Risk Management Framework for detailed
explanations.\
4.4 The ERM Policy and Framework should serve as the basis for Security
Risk Management assessments and associated risk considerations, whilst
additionally taking into account other leading security and mining risk
management practices documents.\
4.5 All personnel should utilise existing risk processes like daily task
risk assessments, planned task observati ons (PTO's), root cause
analysis (RCA's) and other associated software like CURA (ERM),
Perspective (Security Incident Management) and Isometrix (SHE Incident
Management) to be able to assess and manage risk at the respective task,
activity or facility level. 4.6 The basic format and structure of risk
registers will be consistent as defined in the ERM Framework and Policy
and as underpinned within the CURA platform for all operational and
strategic related risk registers. These risk registers will take into
acc ount the following risk management matrix and register template
sections:\
- Risk Impact Rating\
- Likelihood / Probability Rating\
- Control Effectiveness\
- Speed of Onset\
- Risk Trending - Risk Tolerance\
- Risk Response\
4.7 See examples below of risk registers outline

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 19

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
4.8 Controls or action plans will be developed to manage Security risks
to as low as reasonably practical (ALARP).\
4.9 Risk registers will be current and regularly reviewed.\
4.10 The status of all high and very high risks will be reviewed and
updated at least annually to ensure that the controls are still
relevant, applicable and executed as per requirement\
4.11 Critical Controls will be identified for high and very high risks
in diamond areas and will be resourced to be effective in mitigating the
risks and remain resilient to disruption.\
Guidance\
• The main guidance is derived from:\
o ISO 31000  Internationally, this is the main standard that drives
risk management in all domains, whether safety risk management,
financial risk management, operational risk management or security risk
management (There may be many more).\
o The MIRM (Mineral Industry Risk Management Framework):\
 The MIRM is a process that was designed and commissioned between
companies form the extracting industries and the University of Brisbane
in Australia, and is largely used to inform risk management, especially
in the safety domain.\
o NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology:\
 Security risk assessments are unique in the sense that most of the
threats we are faced w ith are adversarial in nature. In order to
understand this type of threat and how it operates, we are guided by the
NIST risk management framework.\
o The concepts of ORM (Operational Risk Management):\
 ORM or Operational Risk Management provides guidance to understand the
way in which risk management is to be applied by following an integrated
approach, thereby ensuring that risk is mitigated at all levels within
the organisation.\
o The diamond security philosophy:\
 In diamond security and loss prevention, a u nique philosophy was
designed and developed over the years that has proven itself beyond
reasonable doubt. A thorough understanding of this provides guidance
especially in understanding the security control environment.\
o The company security policies and p rocedures:\
 Each company has a unique set of security and related policies and
procedures that must be incorporated into the risk management strategy.

MPS 5 - Legal and Regulatory Requirements\
Intent\
To ensure that legal obligations and requirements set the minimum
standards for how Lucara operate s and that Lucara comp lies with all
legal, regulatory, and other associated requirements, including but not
limited to Lucara Botswana, Lucara Botswana Pty Ltd and Karowe Mine
internal policies, standards and public commitments.\
Lucara needs to demonstrate their commitment to ensuring and maintaining
compliance to laws and regulations (current and future laws and
regulations) as a responsible corporate citizen in terms of good
corporate governanc e. Lucara Botswana - with a producing mine (Karowe
Mine) and exploration licenses in Botswana - is a 100% owned Canadian
diamond mining company , falling under the Lucara Diamond Corp oration
structure. Lucara is a member of the Lundin Group of Companies and is
listed on the TSX, Nasdaq Stockholm and the Botswana Stock Exchange
under the symbol "LUC".\
With a local presence and active operation in Botswana, but with
international company holdings, Lucara will be subject to both local and
international laws, ru les and regulations. This requires a view of the
regulatory landscape and achieving compliance to be far wider than just
being Botswana -focussed. Considerations of intra/extra jurisdictional
aspects and their applicability needs to be part of how Lucara Bo tswana
reviews the legal and regulatory requirements.\
For example, reference to the UN Global Compact, OECD Guidelines,
Natural Jewellery Council, Kimberlite Process, Voluntary Principles of
Security and Human Rights (VPSHR), Towards Sustainable Mining ( TSM),
Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC) and UN Sustainable Development
Goals, etc ., to name a few are those that will impact Lucara Botswana
ability to ensure compliance is maintained for those over- arching
practices / guidelines that has been committed to by the holding company
in Lucara Diamond Corporation.\
Required Actions\
5.1 Each operating site (Karowe Diamond Mine and the Gaborone Corporate
Office) will implement and maintain a process that systematically
identifies, registers, updates and assigns both general and specific
external legal and regulatory requirements. These requirements will be
based on organisational position within Lucara as per legal appointment,
as per position as the Head of Department and/or as the appointed Risk /
Compliance Champion.\
5.2 A legal register or similar document should be centrally available
and accessible that serves to account for all applicable statutes that
are required for Lucara to adhere to on an ongoing basis as a mining
company. This should include thos e statutes that may be triggered by an
event/activity/occurrence that are not listed specifically in the legal
register.\
5.3 There will be periodic checks by the legal appointee / Head of
Department / appointed Risk / Compliance Champion to determine their op
erational understanding of the external legal/statutory requirements.
Furthermore, they are to ensure that the legislation being referred to
and applicable to their area of operation, is current and that their
inputs to assess, update and attain compliance thereto, is being
maintained to the required standards for audit and monitoring purposes.\
5.4 Legal and other requirements will inform associated direct or
ancillary work processes that may need to be communicated appropriately
to relevant employees and/or co ntractors.

To ensure that operational failures are minimised and the process of
mining, liberating, washing, recovering, sorting and selling diamond is
clearly understood, in control, measured and reconciled throughout.\
Required Actions\
Mining 7.1 Mining of kimberlite deposits can expose diamond rich ore,
where this is the case care will be taken to coordinate mining and
security so that where possible the mining process leaves as little ore
exposed as possible.\
7.2 Process plants will be established on hard concrete bases with
drainage to allow for adequate cleaning away of spillage.\
Note: Only buildings such as Crushers, Screens, Water tanks, Bins, Mill,
DMS, MDR, Thickener, Recovery, XRT and Audit Plants, this element is
compliant.\
7.3 For operations and maintenance tasks with significant security
risks, identified controls will be incorporated into procedures and work
practices.\
7.4 The Process Manager and Engineering Manager will determine the
optimum mode of operation for control loops in the DMS (or HMS) and
Recovery as well as MDR and XRT Plants.\
7.4.1 This will be documented and auditable; a record will be kept of
any deviation from the optimum mode, who made the change and why
(Management of Change process).\
Note: The Process change database is used to capture all Engineering and
Process changes that are made on the Process Plant and this includes
changes that could affect optimum mode. The information includes risk
assessment in terms of safety, security and process, why the change, who
sensitized the change and whether is a short -term or long -term
change.\
7.4.2 A list of "bypasses" on the control loops, instrumentation and
control circuits will be reviewed for high -risk areas and equipment.
These will be repaired with priority.\
7.5 The process flow will be used to confirm the results of the
following manipulations of process logic are known to operators,
security and surveillance.\

to manipulate the process or establish pockets for collecting Diamonds
or 'theft lines' like audit lines within the process machinery and
piping.\
Required Actions\
Maintenance\
8.1 Planned Maintenance Shutdowns: A procedure will be in place that
ensures in spection of any equipment after planned maintenance that
occurs in recovery areas. The diamond recovery circuit will not be
started until this is done. (The inspection will be done under dual
accountability by a plant and security person).\
8.2 Unplanned Mainte nance: A procedure will be in place that ensures
inspection of any equipment after unplanned maintenance that occurs in
recovery areas. The diamond recovery circuit will not be started until
this is done. (The inspection will be done under dual accountabil ity by
a plant and security person).\
8.3 Equipment and machinery will be classified according to Security
risk and criticality by maintenance (or reliability), security and
processing specialists. The asset management strategy will determine the
maintenance r outine for the various equipment at recovery area:\
8.4 Security personnel shall attend maintenance planning meetings and
avail resources timely for effective maintenance planning and
execution.\
Housekeeping\
8.5 Demarcation and adhering to demarcation: the storage of equipment
and tools will be kept at a minimum in high -risk areas. Areas for
storage of equipment will be clearly demarcated and adhered to. There
will be no storage of waste products in high security areas.\
8.6 Following maintenance or the change -out of e quipment, all waste
will be removed from high -risk areas within 12 hours. If security is
required to clear waste/equipment, the security department will be given
prior notice of the maintenance taking place during production and
maintenance planning meeti ngs. 8.7 The Diamond Control Committee
members (individually or as a team) will regularly inspect the high
-risk areas with a focus on the housekeeping and provide feedback to the
Steering committee (ST) meeting at least quarterly.\
8.8 Equipment in high -risk areas resulting in spillage will be repaired
with a high priority to a state of no spillage. Where regular spillage
occurs with no practical solution to repair the equipment, controls will
be in place to prevent regular access to the area and the spillage
controlled using a hands -off or mechanical method.

9.6 Workplace design and engineering in high -risk diamond areas such as
proc ess plants, recovery, XRT, MDR and the sort -house will consider
potential security impacts and seek to design security into the
operation rather than impose it afterwards once designed.\
9.7 Management of change is critical to the upkeep of technical systems.
For changes to technical systems, the change process will include a back
out plan, backup of initial configuration, stakeholder engagement
including a communication plan of the change and updates to the drawings
and new configurations.\
Guidance\
• The early involvement and consultation with security is to ensure that
to the greatest extent possible security measures are designed into the
operating environment rather than being imposed on it afterwards with
the resulting loss of operational efficiency and secu rity
effectiveness.

qualified person or entity independent from the diamond processing ope
rations, at regular intervals as agreed, the results of which should be
communicated to a designated audience (Also to be agreed upon) including
but not limited to the Risk Manager: Security, who should include this
report as part of the overall security m etrics.\
10.16 An investigation into OTL's should be properly recoded with all
evidence recorded for proper management oversight and to enable remote
assurance.\
10.17 The principle of "two -person accountability" should always be
applied during consignment and/or batch weighing and reconciliation to
avoid human error.\
10.18 Diamond scales will be calibrated by BOBS (The Botswana bureau of
standards) at least twice bi -annually and evidence kept for auditing
purposes.\
10.19 Although essential diamond scale calibrations by BOBS, will n ot
be the only way of verifying scale integrity. BOBS calibrated scales
will be counter checked daily by means of "check weighing".\
10.20 Each time a diamond weighing discrepancy is detected, as a first
order of business, "Check weighing" should be performed to verify scale
integrity.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 36

10.21 Diamond batches will always be accompanied by systems generated
parcelling letters against which reconciliation will take place.\
10.22 Individual diamonds as well as diamond batches will be
packed/parcelled and moved/transported in approv ed containers only.\
10.23 Apart from the parcelling letters, container, parcel contents will
be identified/described by means of barcoded labels.\
10.24 At each reconciliation point within the system, container contents
will be verified by:\
10.24.1 Scanning the barcodes on t he containers with scanners directly
connected with the stock management system to circumvent human
involvement\
10.24.2 Performing positive identification (Verifying that the contents
of the containers match the information contained in the parcelling
letters and the barcoded labels) of the contents through weigh
reconciliation.\
10.25 The manual capturing of barcode labels is prohibited and should
only be overridden through a change management process, i.e., by
submitting and obtaining approval for such deviation by submitting a
deviation request.\
10.26 Performing unauthorised weight reconciliation off- line is
prohibited and should be recorded as an incident (Procedural breach) and
immediately escalated for investigation.\
10.27 Off-line weight reconciliation may be authorised following a
change management process (Deviation request) in the event of diamond
weight reconciliation \*system failures, at which time additional
security controls that are specifically risk based will be assigned.
(Refer to systems failure for additional measures).\
10.28 As a technical control, diamond weighs should not be captured
and/or recorded manually, but rather, scales should be linked directly
with the stock management system to enable the automated recording of
diamond weights by circumventi ng human involvement.\
10.29 A well -defined procedure involving the principles of "two -person
accountability", consisting of members from security as well as stock
control, and the establishment of an audit trail, will be followed for
the granting of permission t o proceed with diamond processing after a
weight reconciliation discrepancy was encountered and the diamond
reconciliation system is overridden to proceed.\
10.30 All authorised procedural breaches should be reported and recorded
in the security incident manageme nt system accompanied by the "proof of
authorisation" to enable remote assurance.\
10.31 The import weight reconciliation report to the government will be
systems generated with automated prompting and alert functionality to
avoid human error.\
10.32 Diamond reconciliation system access will be subject to biometric
identification and controlled through the personnel access management
system with an audit trail to enable remote assurance.\
10.33 Access to the diamond reconciliation system will be removed
through a non -human dependant process when no longer required, such as
when services are terminated or inter departmental transfers take place.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 37

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
10.34 Diamond weight reconciliation systems will be designed such that
no further diamond processing could take place unless weight reconci
liation falls within tolerance and all other criterium is complied with,
with an automated alert system via the Fantasy System to notify
identified role -players, including, but not limited to security.\
10.35 To enable remote assurance, and direct surveillance, n on-diamonds
and/or gangue found in diamond batches will be:\
10.35.1 Checked to verify its non -diamond status following the
principle of 2 -person accountability, making use of accepted
technology, i.e., diamond testers.\
10.35.2 Reconciled against overall batch weight\
10.35.3 Remov ed from the diamond batches in a controlled manner, in
accordance with procedure.\
10.35.4 Handled as if it were diamonds.\
10.35.5 Sealed in containers\
10.35.6 Dispatched back to the mine in a controlled manner.\
10.35.7 Checked at the mine to verify its non -diamond status, making
use of a ccepted technology, i.e., diamond testers.\
10.35.8 Discarded at the mine, in a controlled manner.\
10.36 The entire process of handling non -diamonds and/or gangue found
in diamond batches will be contained in a procedure and recorded in such
a way that an audit trail would be available, evidence of which is to be
included in the security incident management system.\
10.37 Each day, at the end of day, there should be a system generated
batch check with automated alarming capabilities to ensure that
individual batches are in fact returned for overnight storage.\
Diamond damage, breakage and contamination 10.38 The following physical
measures should be in place to avoid diamond damage and/or breakage:\
10.38.1 Desks for diamond processing will be designed to be "drop
friendly".\
10.38.2 Desks should have raised edges that would assist in preventing
diamonds from dropping off tables.\
10.38.3 Floors in diamond handling area should be carpeted.\
10.38.4 Desks for diamond processing should have partitioning in place,
(minimum 50 cm high) to avoid accidental batch c ontamination between
diamond sorting stations.\
Power supply and systems redundancy\
10.39 Diamond processing operations, including security should have a
power supply system in place that would be readily available should
power supply from the main power grid fail at any time thereby negating
a total dependency on the country's main power grid.\
10.40 Based on an analysis of power supply failure durations, the backup
power supply should be sufficient to provide uninterrupted operational
functionality.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 38

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
10.41 The backup power supply system will be designed to perform an
automated systems check on a weekly basis, that is not human dependent,
with alarming capability in the event of a failure.\
10.42 Switch- over from the main grid to the backup power supply should
be seamless with no apparent interruption in power supply.\
10.43 Through a risk assessment process, those critical single points of
failure that would result in gross operational disruption and/or
immobilisation, should be identified, and contingency plans, including
an equipme nt redundancy plan should be in place to ensure rapid
recovery from disaster, as well as uninterrupted systems availability at
these critical points.\
Systems failure\
10.44 There should be a standing operating procedure (SOP) in place that
explains the step s that should be followed in the event of a 3systems
failure. Included in the SOP should be the following requirements:\
10.44.1 That such systems failure should immediately be reported and
recorded.\
10.44.2 That diamonds should immediately be separated from human
contact.\
10.44.3 That, as a first order of business, immediately after systems
restoration, weight reconciliation should be performed.\
Key management and control\
10.45 There will be a procedure(s) in place that governs the management
of safe and vault keys.\
10.46 All safe and vault keys are to be kept and dispatched from the
electronic key management system linked to the access management system
making use of the principles of 2-person accountability, such
accountability of which should be vested in both the stock control and
the security department.\
10.47 Information collected in the electronic key management system
database will be submitted for analysis with reports included as p art
of the security metrics.\
10.48 The procedure that governs the management of safe and vault keys
will stipulate the way in which incidents involving breaches of the key
management process should be reported, escalated, and investigated, as
an obligatory requirement.\
Additional criteria\
10.49 To prevent major disruption of operations and/or loss in revenue,
there should be a clear understanding encapsulated in written format
that stipulates the minimum requirements that diamond shipment, diamond
reconciliation, stoc k control and sales operations should comply with
to ensure compliance with:\
10.49.1 Insurance requirements to ensure that insurance claims are not
rejected.\
10.49.2 Government expectations to prevent confiscation of diamond
consignments.

3 \*Systems failures include, but is not limited to internet failure,
bandwidth limitations, electrical or power supply failure, machine
failure, technical failure, equipment failure security control failure
or the impeding of systems, equipment and/or machine functionality.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 39

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
10.49.3 Due diligences should be conduct ed at agreed intervals to
verify that insurance requirements and government expectations are:\
• Understood and internalised by all stakeholders.\
• Complied with as part of the day -to-day operations.\
• Included as part of sound governance practices.

10.50 Security control design, implementation and execution should be
void of human based trust relationships.\
Process auditability\
10.51 Information contained in the Stock Management System should be
provided in a clear unambiguous format and be readily available.\
10.52 Stock Management System reports should be collated with other
security related information.\
10.53 Reconciliation points should be established and clearly defined
within the production pipeline and regularly reviewed to ensure
alignment with business requirements\
10.54 All notifications of anomalies via the stock management system
should be reported. The reporting platforms should be identified, and
the escalation protocols defined in writing, including but not limited
to the persons, roles and responsibilities that would be involved in the
escalation process.\
10.55 Sales operations should have a plan in place to conduct regular
(targeted and random) audits in order to:\
10.55.1 Confirm that physical diamonds are recorded and accounted for by
the stock management system.\
10.55.2 Confirm that all non-compliances are reported.\
10.55.3 Confirm that non -compliance reports are reduced.\
10.56 A written audit investigations process should be in place to
analyse information to determine trends based on reports received from
the Stock Management System.\
Network security\
10.57 E-mail correspondence with external parties and stakeholders
containing information related to any of the following aspects should be
encrypted:\
10.57.1 Diamond shipment\
10.57.2 Individual diamond and/or diamond parcel descriptions

10.58 The following information sec urity measures should be in place:\
10.58.1 BitLocker drive encryption

10.58.2 Perimeter firewall to protect against external/internal threats\
10.58.3 Regularly updated antivirus programmes for internal and external
threats\
10.58.4 Phishing campaigns for user awareness should be perform ed at
regular intervals, the interval durations of which should be clearly
defined\
10.59 Individual user access to diamond stock control programmes should
be controlled by limiting it to only those who need access to perform
daily stock control duties and only b e relevant for that part, section,
or phase that a specific user is required to perform duties at.\
10.60 User fields should be defined while multiple user fields per
individual, should not be permitted unless specifically authorised after
a change management pr ocess of which evidence should be readily
available, has been followed.\
10.61 Individual user access to stock management systems should be
gained through biometric login.\
Quality control\
10.62 There should be pre -identified points within the diamond
processing pipeli ne referred to as quality checkpoints, where 4quality
assurance needs to be performed, the aim of which would be to prevent
certain security threats from materialising.\
10.63 5Quality standards at these "quality checkpoints", should be
clearly defined for eac h point, while those performing quality checks
should be trained and declared competent to do so.\
10.64 The stock control management system should make provision for the
following:\
10.64.1 Progress to the next stage or phase within the diamond
processing pipeline should not be possible unless quality assurance was
performed.\
10.64.2 Provision must be made for an audit trail within the system of
all quality checks that were performed to enable assurance.\
Competent people\
The processing of diamonds, and the preparat ion of such for diamond
sales is a specialist function requiring skilled and competent personnel
from a variety of disciplines to prepare and secure sales parcels in
such a way that diamond value is optimised and events that may be the
cause of possible loss of revenue, eliminated.

4 At certain "checkpoints" within the diamond processing pipeline,
especially where human involvement is a primary requiremen t to process
diamonds, capture information and/or evaluate diamonds. At these points
a next level of oversight may be needed. These levels of oversight are
designed, dependent on the identified need, and may involve peer
oversight (Also known as 2 -person accountability), such as when weight
reconciliation is performed, Security oversight (such as when checks
need to be performed to verify that certain procedures were complied
with) and supervisory or management oversight (such as when a next level
of expert ise or authentication may be required).

5 Quality standards are designed to provide clear guidelines to those
performing quality checks and may include but need not be limited to
setting the minimum sampling requirement.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 41

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
To achieve this close coordination between the various disciplines is
needed, whereby each identified stakeholder within the process knows
his/her role and function and are trained and equipped to perform that
role and function.\
The competency requirement for each role is unique and skills to perform
those roles and functions are obtained through a variety of mediums,
some being formal and some being informal.\
The aim and purpose of the set of criteria that follows will be to
establish a system to ensure that persons who have not been equipped for
the various roles and functions they perform will not pe permitted to
perform those roles and functions unless they have been declared
competent, and able to maintain certain competency s tandards.\
Stakeholders/role -players in the processing of diamonds include but are
not limited to:\
• Stock Controllers\
• Diamond Technicians\
• Quality Assurers\
• Diamond Risk Officers\
• Supervisory roles\
• Management functions

10.65 The diamond processing pipeline should be clearly defined with
most currently updated and signed off PFD's (Process Flow Diagrams)
readily available and auditable.\
10.66 Roles and functions of persons involved within the diamond
processing pipeline should be identified, clearly defined, and linked to
the steps, phases and/or stages within that process.\
10.67 Competency and skills profiles for each of the roles and functions
identified for each of the steps, phases and/or stages within the
diamond processing pipeline at the sales offices should be rea dily
available, current, and signed off.\
10.68 The way in which skills and/or competencies are obtained should be
defined, i.e., formal, or informal.\
10.69 There should be a process in place to verify that personnel used
in the various roles and functions are competen t, having been declared
as such and having been certified as such.\
10.70 There should be controls in place and where relevant supported by
audit trails, to verify that persons will not be used to perform roles
and functions for which they are not qualified i.e., for which they have
been declared and certified as being competent.\
10.71 Where competency requirements involve formal training, authentic
records of learning achievements should be readily available for
auditing purposes.\
10.72 Where competency requirements involve informal, i.e., on -the-job
training guidance and/or coaching, such training should be tracked and
records maintained (for example a training matrix supported by a
training logbook, job observations and assessments etc.) and readily
available for auditing p urposes.\
10.73 As a minimum requirement and in addition to requirements specified
elsewhere in the LDCS, Diamond Risk Officers deployed at diamond sales
and trading operations should receive training on the following aspects:

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 42

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
10.73.1 Distinguishing between diamond and n on-diamond stones.\
10.73.2 Knowing the diamond processing pipeline at diamond sales and
trading operations and the typical security risks that may be
encountered at each of the steps, phases and/or stages including but not
limited to knowing how the diamond Stock Management system interlinks
with the process and how it functions.\
10.73.3 Knowing what their role and function involves when required to
perform oversight of processes and transactions including but not
limited to the typical errors and/or anomalies that may be encountered
that may result in either diamond loss or loss of revenue to the
company.\
10.73.4 Understanding diamond evaluation i.e., the 4 C's.\
10.73.5 The processes involved when check weighing i s performed.\
Key equipment and components used in diamond stock control and sales
processes processing equipment\
10.74 There should be standard in place that specifies the minimum
requirements that all key equipment and components used in diamond stock
control and sales processes should comply with.\
10.75 There should be an equipment redundan cy plan in place for all key
equipment and components used in diamond stock control and sales
processes to ensure ongoing operational

Exposure to diamonds\
11.9 There will be a procedure(s) in place that governs reporting and
rectification of all diamond drops, pick -ups, and spillages within the
diamond processes. This procedure should also specify the requirements
that should be met when detaining people, pending the resolving of
weight reconciliation discrepancies to ensure that the human rights of
people related to privacy and freedom of movement is not interfered
with.\
11.10 Procedures that govern the way in which diamonds will remain in
secure storage, until required for a particular processing activity,
thereby avoiding unnecessary exposure will be in place and complied
with.\
11.11 Included in the procedures that govern the w ay in which
individual stones should be evaluated, should be the requirement that
only one stone may be exposed at any given time during the evaluation
process.\
11.12 Include as part of the golden rules at trading operations the
requirement that only one stone may be exposed at any given time during
the evaluation process.\
Manual handling, processing and information capturing 11.13 Two -person
accountability processes, and/or quality control measures involving a
next level pf superiority and/or external departmental, i.e., security
oversight should be in place as a control measure to avoid human error
at pre -identified points within the diamond processing pipeline where
the processing of diamonds are primarily conducted through human
involvement, included but not limited to the following:\
• When repricing the mix -logic.

11.14 When or wherever two -person accountability and/or next level
quality control is a requirement within the diamond processing pipeline,
the technical system used, i.e., stock control, and/or diamond
processing systems, should make provision for a second pers on to sign
in based on his/her authorised user profile within the system and
confirm that data arrangements are correct before progress to the next
step/phase in the process will be permitted by the system, and an audit
trail of the transactions should be readily available, and submitted
together with other reports such as OTL reports.\
Network security\
11.15 All correspondence with outside entities, parties and stakeholders
containing information related to individual stones, consignments and/or
parcels, including file attachments and adv files, should be encrypted.\
11.16 E-mail correspondence with external parties and stakeholders
containing information related to any of the following aspects should be
encrypted:\
11.16.1 Diamond shipment\
11.16.2 Individual diamond and/or diamond parcel descriptions\

11.17.3 Defining user fields while multiple user fields per individual,
should not be permitted unless specifically authorised after a change
management process of which evidence should be readily available, has
been followed. The authorisation of multiple user fields to a single
individual should only be allowed if the principle if "single person
responsibility" is not violated.\
Diamond movement\
11.18 Diamond movement between buildings and facilities should be
performed securely and controls should be in place to avoid any diamond
movement from taking place without security being involved.\
11.19 There should be a procedure in place that governs the way in which
diamonds are moved between buildings and facilities linking the Sales
and Clara offices.\
11.20 Where diamond processing operations are situated near e ach other,
i.e., when separated by a wall or floor, automated diamond movement,
(i.e., vacuum transfer system) should be used as a medium of transport.\
11.21 Directly before, and directly after diamond movement, weight
reconciliation should be performed an audit trail of which should be
available.\
Stock control\
11.22 The transfer of diamond stock between two different stock
management systems (i.e., Fantasy and Galaxy) should be automated, i.e.,
the systems should be interlinked to ensure a smooth transitio n of
diamond stock between the 2 components and to circumvent human
involvement in the transition process.\
Diamond damage\
11.23 There should be a procedure in place that define the tolerance
levels in terms of "chip size" that would constitute a reportable
incident in the event of stones that are chipped.\

13.3.7 Their obligation to report wrongdoing or suspected wrongdoing.\
Training 13.4 There will be a process for delivery and maintenance of
competency -based training for the Security Team and personnel working
in high -risk diamond areas that includes and integrates the practical
management of Security risks.\
13.5 All personnel working in diamond areas \[including Security
personnel\] or in diamond entrusted roles will undergo specific training
related to Security in the conduct of their duties.\
13.6 Where there is a requirement for interventions into the diamond
recovery circuit, and it is practicable to do so, a standard and
authorised method of doing th e task should be developed with an
associated Single Point Brief and these should form part of the security
awareness training.\
13.7 Security awareness training delivered to those people working in
high -risk diamond areas is to focus on the specific requirement s and
expectations of the outcomes of the security or diamond controls rules
and procedures.\
Standard Operating Procedures and Golden Rules\
13.8 All departments should produce Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
detailing the steps to take for all tasks.\
13.9 The S OPs for higher security risk diamond areas will be
particularly detailed and inform surveillance in identifying non
-conformities.\
13.10 The SOPs for higher security risk diamond areas should be
distilled into Single Point Briefs making use of pictures and simple
instructions which will be posted where the task takes place and used to
inform training (and surveillance observations).\
13.11 The operation is encouraged to develop a short list (should not be
more than 7 key points) of Golden Rules which all personnel will be made
aware of and must follow, and which carry consequences if they are not
follow.\
Consequence Models\
13.12 The Human Resources team will develop a clearly understood
consequence model for breaches of Golden Rules. This will be explained
to all personnel. \[Guidance: where possible personnel should sign the
Golden Rules to confirm that they fully understand them and the
implications of not observing them.\
Exit Process\
13.13 The Human Resources team will inform the security team within one

MPS 14 - Engagement and Communication Intent\
To communicate effectively with our stakeholders and engage all
personnel in contributing to our success. Security and Diamond Control
is not a security only responsibility but should include all staff.\
Required Actions\
14.1 There will be an effective two -way Security communications
processes put in place to supp ort this. The Security Manager and
Security Team will continuously engage the entire workforce in the
security program and there have an ongoing employee engagement plan in
place. The intention is to create a security community at the workplace
that consis t of all.\
14.2 All employees should have a basic understanding of the security
risks in the workplace and how to deal with them to ensure that the
company assets are protected. This should be included in the employee
induction program and cover topics like, th e crime continuum, nature of
theft and reasons why people steal and countermeasures to prevent theft
and loss. Most people are honest and this should be the focus of the
training so that the majority will see the value in the protection of
the company from losses.\
14.3 All employees should know how to report security incidents and/or
security failures. Such reports should be investigated with feedback to
the reporter. The number of such reports should be tracked and reported
to the DCC on a quarterly basis. Effe ctive plans should be put in place
to encourage reporting by employees.\
14.4 An employee engagement survey should be conducted at least every
second year to measure the extent of employee involvement in the
security program and well as their view of the securit y effort.
Feedback should eb provided and their assistance sought to improve
security engagement.\
14.5 All leaders / Heads of Department / Chain of Custody Owners at the
operation will be able to answer these questions:\
14.5.1 Do we have a list of all our assets and know where they are?\
14.5.2 What are the specific risks in this area that could contribute to
the loss of product and assets?\
14.5.3 How are these risks controlled?\
14.5.4 What is your specific role in ensuring that these controls are in
place?\
14.5.5 What will you do if you see that one of these controls is not in
place?\
14.5.6 How do you work with Security to continuously improve security of
assets?\
14.5.7 Consultative processes will be in place to identify, assess and
control security risks at operational, task and individual levels.\
14.6 The security department will assist Leaders / Heads of Department /
Chain of Custody Owners to put security plans in place for the areas
under their control and ensure that those plans are executed by the
security team members.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 53

14.7 The Risk Manager: Security will brief all new managers and Heads of
Department on our approach to their specific accountability within two
weeks of their arrival in post. This briefing will be recorded in the
minutes of the next Diamond Control Committee meeting.\
14.8 Each operation will det ermine working languages in diamond areas
so that work can be conducted safely, and communications understood by
management, workers and security. \[Guidance: where groups of people are
working the language will be understood by all group members or there
will not be side discussions in a language that others do not
understand.\
Signage\
14.9 Each operation should develop signage supporting security
communications. Such signage could:\
14.9.1 be posted prominently at the entrance to diamond areas, and mine
site entrances.\
14.9.2 make use of simple pictures to explain their points.\
14.9.3 be in English and the local language; and\
14.9.4 indicate that cameras are used for surveillance.\
Guidance\
• External stakeholder engagement is also key.\
o They include law enforcement agencies and diamo nd security
organisations.\
• A strong relationship and a good working environment conducive to co
-operation is needed if the malicious and non -malicious loss of
precious stones is to be stopped at our mines and across into other
countries.\
• So, collaboratio n between law enforcement agencies and diamond
security must be nurtured.

MPS 15 -- Continuous Improvement\
Intent\
To ensure we continuously improve our approach to Security with
knowledge gained from incidents, non -conformities, new operations,
questionin g from stakeholders and management review of this Standard.\
Required Actions\
Security Incident Reviews\
15.1 Each site should have a system and procedure for managing Security
incidents that specifies requirements for: reporting, recording,
investigating, analysis, managing actions and communications.\
15.2 An incident escalation procedure should be developed and followed.\
15.3 All incidents, including near hits, should be reported.\
15.4 All incidents will be classified and reported based on maximum
reasonable outcome (MRO) and actual outcome using the Lucara Botswana
5x5 risk matrix -- See Annex C.\
15.5 All recordable losses, significant incidents (including significant
potential incidents), will be reported to the General Manager (as soon
as possible) and to the MD of Lucara Botswana (within 24 hours).\
15.6 External reporting of incidents to regulators will occur in
accordance with relevant legislation and be managed by the operating
site with advice from legal counsel.\
15.7 For each incident, an accountable leader will be responsible for
ensuring a timely investigation appropriate to the risk and complexity.
The Managing Director of Lucara Botswana or the Lucara Diamond
Corporation Chief Executive Officer will mandate and delegate the
appropriate level and type of investigation that is required.\
15.8 Investigations will be supported by competent people, appropriate
to the risk and complexity o f the circumstances. Decisions on who
supports investigations will be authorised by the General Manager.\
15.9 There will be a process for recording, approving and implementing
business improvement recommendations arising from incident
investigations.\
15.10 There will be a process for reviewing the status and effectiveness
of implemented controls for significant Security incidents over time.\
15.11 Learnings from significant Security incidents will be shared
across the Lucara Botswana business within seven days. An example o f
such a communication is at Annex M.\

MPS 16 - Physical Security\
Intent\
To ensure that we have adequate physical security measures in place that
are integrated with people, procedures and technical systems.\
Required Actions\
Security Policy\
16.1 A security policy must be in place. By in place, it is implied that
the policy is:\
16.1.1 Published on the internalised document repository and readily
accessible to all stakeholders.\
16.1.2 Communicated to employees and relevant external parties.\
16.1.3 Monitored to ensure its continuous application.\
16.1.4 Reviewed as and when circumstances may dictate but at lea st once
per year to ensure alignment with business requirements.\
16.2 Evidence that input was received from stakeholders and accommodated
in the policy must be available.\
16.3 Procedures that support the policy must be in place, by in place it
is implied that the procedure is:\
16.3.1 Aligned with the physical security policy.\
16.3.2 Implemented based on management approval and sign -off. 16.3.3
Published on the internalised document repository and readily accessible
by all stakeholders.\
16.3.4 Communicated to employees and relevant external part ies. 16.3.5
Monitored to verify its continuous application.\
16.3.6 Reviewed as and when circumstances may dictate but at least once
per year to ensure alignment with business requirements.\
Design based on reliable risk assessment.\
16.4 The physical security design will be ba sed on a risk assessment
that exhibits a clear understanding of:\
16.4.1 The Lucara Botswana facility's operations and conditions.\
16.4.2 Threats to the organisation reflected in a threat register based
on a threat analysis that highlights priority threats.\
16.4.3 Vulnerability severity based on a vulnerability assessment of the
various lifecycles, processes and facilities in the organisation.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 56

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
16.4.4 Prioritised risk levels reflected in a risk register that is
dynamically updated to reflect real security risk to the organisation.\
16.4.5 Risk mitigation, whereby:\
16.4.5.1 An action plan is compiled to mitigate the identified risk.\
16.4.5.2 The action plan is executed, monitored and controlled.\
16.4.5.3 Management is provided with feedback showing the level of risk
mitigation achieved.\
16.4.5.4 The security control environment where controls are measured
and monitored on a continuous basis to reflect control relevance,
effectiveness and to verify that real risk is in fact mitigated.\
16.5 Risk awareness is reflected within the various levels of the
organisation, including but not limited to:\
16.5.1 Senior management level i.e., baseline risk register reflecting
the organisation security risk profile.\
16.5.2 Issue based level, i.e., supported by a mechanism whereby day
-to-day risks are identified, analysed and incorporated into the
organisation risk profile so as to keep the risk profile current and up
to date.\
16.5.3 Supervisory level i.e., risk identification, mitigation and
control verification for each job or task, whether formal or informal.\
16.5.4 Employee level, i.e., continuous risk management b y each
employee within the organisation.\
16.6 A mechanism to identify and mitigate critical risks supported by a
TARP, Trigger Action Response Plan, or any similar mechanism is in place
to ensure resilience, i.e., recovery from disaster within the shortest
peri od. 16.7 Critical risk identification should reflect the common
mode failure points where the failure of a single element of the
security system significantly compromises security.\
16.8 Risk management and risk assessment practices are integrated in the
company proj ect management system verified by the fact that information
collected during the risk assessment phase, including risk mitigating
measures is recorded and stored with the engineering documentation.\
16.9 Risk mitigation implementation is well supported by a quality
assurance process whereby any new installation for a technical device
(Sensor, Camera etc.) will have a technical evaluation completed, while
non -technical installations undergo scrutiny to verify the quality of
the installation in support of the risk assessment and to verify that
the intended benefit has been realised.\
16.10 The physical security controls outlined in Annex F will be
expected, unless a risk assessment determines otherwise, in which case
Annex F will be reviewed to reflect the findings of the\
risk assessment i.e., Annex F forms part of the mandatory requirement.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 57

Perimeter Protection and Access Control\
16.11 Diamond facilities will have perimeter protection measures in
place as outlined in Annex F, to protect the product and personnel and
allow for the imposition of access control. Fence design should be based
on a risk assessment identifying the clear and present threats and
vulnerabilities, taking into account the way in which the threats may
exploit the vulnerabilities. Fence design must be such t hat it
mitigates the risks that have been identified during the risk
assessment.\
Example 1 -- In Northern Canada the erecting of fences is impossible due
to the snowfall that makes fence maintenance impossible and impractical.
The operation there have implemented video covered surveillance
"fencing" that alerts access. It should also be noted that the closest
communities are hundreds of miles away that makes access the sites in
summer almost impossible and in winter only by winter roads that are
well patrolled.\
Example 2 -- The diamond vessel operating at sea does not have a fence
around it for obvious reasons but means of access to the vessel is
monitored by intrusion systems and cameras creating a virtual fence.\
16.12 The organisation must:\
16.12.1 Develop an access cont rol procedure or procedures that govern
the authorisation of required access into various areas.\
16.12.2 Communicate the procedure that governs the authorisation of
required access into various areas to relevant external stakeholders.\
16.12.3 Implement the procedure that govern the authorisation of
required access into various areas by establishing a monitoring
capability to verify implementation.\
16.12.4 Review procedure that governs the authorisation of required
access into various areas as and when circumstances may dictate but at
least once per year to ensure alignment with business requirements.\
16.13 As a minimum requirement the access control procedure must contain
the requirement that, the mine, process plants, recovery areas, sort-
houses and other diamond areas will control acce ss and record the
movements of all personnel, vehicle and material movement in and out of
the area. The level of access is determined by the risk profile of the
area and should be reflected in the procedure as such.\
16.14 Access and egress patterns for all people, vehicles and
goods/materials must be auditable and data readily available on an
electronic platform for analytical purposes.\
16.15 Reasons for access into high -risk areas, processes and machines
and the man -hours spent in proximity and/or contact with di
amondiferous material must be recorded for statistical purposes to
manage and reduce physical contact with diamondiferous material.\
16.16 Reasons for access into high -risk areas will be based on a
specific need to access and approved by the Risk Manager (Securi ty).
CCTV Coverage\
16.17 Visual chain of custody of interactions between product and people
is required. The layout of CCTV cameras will be finalised after the
process and security stakeholders agree to the camera purpose and
expected outcomes.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 58

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
16.18 Camera placement and application will be fit for purpose, based on
a camera risk assessment that considers but is not limited to:\
16.18.1 Camera functional requirement\
16.18.2 Camera technical specifications\
16.18.3 Recording requirements\
16.18.4 Redundancy requirements\
16.19 A fixed camera footprint will be used for diamond areas and PTZ
will only be used as secondary support. In any high -risk diamond areas,
cameras will cover all locations where there is people and product
interaction and the flow of people and product through the area.\
16.20 Standby, portable c ameras should be readily available inside high
-risk areas to mitigate security risk in accordance with a Job Risk
Assessment, that is conducted prior to all high -risk area
equipment/human interfaces, should the fixed camera footprint proof
inadequate to mitigate the identified risk.\
Biometric scanners\
16.21 At dedicated entry points of the mine and all diamond handling
buildings, biometrics will be used as an identification tool.\
Security Zoning 16.22 Security zoning at Karowe Mine and Corporate
Office (Diamond Technology Park) shall conform to the following:\
16.22.1 White Area - Zone One:\
The white area zone consists of:\
16.22.1.1 public access areas.\
16.22.1.2 Outside Mine perimeter and at public foyers\

Employee access will be strictly con trolled based on a need to enter,
through personal identity verification, i.e., biometrics, as well as
card access. Only contractors and visitors with a need to know and
closely escorted will be authorised to enter.\
16.23 The red or high -risk area in a mining concession must comply with
the following as minimum requirement:\
16.23.1 The red or high -risk area must be situated inside an impervious
shell and/or have perimeter security that will minimise the risk of
unauthorised access and theft of diamonds and/or diamond iferous
material.\
16.23.2 All process streams and associated process units will be
protected by means of physical barriers to prevent unauthorised access.\
16.23.3 Access to process control units must be controlled through the

16.23.4 Provide for audit trails whereby access to process units and the
reasons for gaining access can be monitored.\
16.23.5 Where physical contact is possible between members of the blue
and red areas, the red or high -risk area must have a double perimeter
protection facility with a no - man's land in -between to reduce contact
with people not situated in the red area.\
16.24 Prioritising of alarms (and their annunciation in the alarm
monitoring system) should follow from these layers with the alarms on
the most likely targets given clear priority over other alarms or
notifications.\
16.25 The surveillance room and security data equip ment room will be
within a wider security perimeter and have additional access control
specific to the people that need to work there and have visual signs
indicating that only authorised personnel may enter.\
Key Control and Padlocks\
16.26 The use and distributi on of keys and padlocks will be tightly
controlled and subject to written protocols. The protocols will ensure
these controls are in place and describe the methodology supporting dual
-key systems, and any variances.\
16.27 Padlocks are not to be left unlocked an d unattended. When
padlocks are not securing the item, - (for instance if maintenance is
being carried out) they should be locked and secured to another place so
that they cannot be swapped.\
16.28 Access to keys should be controlled in a manner that is auditabl e
and based on confirmed personal custody of keys. \[Guidance: This is
likely to be achieved through the use of either biometrics or access
control cards to access the key cupboard.\]\
16.29 The Risk Manager: S ecurity will ensure a random audit of key
control at l east every quarter and report findings to the operation's
DCC.\
\[Guidance -- Key Control and Padlocks: Where operations personnel
control one of the dual custody keys the chain of custody owner is
responsible for the security of the key and should be made aw are of the
importance of key control by the Security manager.\]\
Seals\
16.30 The placement of a seal will not be considered as providing a
physical security control on its own.\
16.31 The selection of seals will be based on the security requirement
according to risk. Seals that protect high value goods will be uniquely
numbered, not readily copied or reproduced and their continuity proven
when used.\
16.32 The Risk Manager (Security) will arrange for regular, random
audits of high -risk seals and report on these to the DCC. The f
ollowing must be verified during seal audits:\
16.32.1 Unplaced seals are safely stored and dispatched from a single
point of control. All dispatches are accounted for.\
16.32.2 Seal batches are issued to only a limited number of persons who
have been clearly authorised to be in possession of such seal batches.
Seal batches are kept/stored safely.

16.45 All entries and exits to the high -risk diamond areas will be
recorded so that subsequent analysis can be made of ratios of people
searched.\
16.46 Searches will be conducted and witnessed by people of the same sex
as the person being searched.\
16.47 Searches will be witnessed (surveillance can provide a witness if
ap propriate) and the following will be recorded:\
16.47.1 time of the search,\
16.47.2 name of the person being searched,\
16.47.3 name of the person doing the search and\
16.47.4 name of the witness, as well as\
16.47.5 the level of the search.\
16.48 Where there is a reliance on physical searches of the person there
will be at least two levels of personnel search:\
16.48.1 A Physical full body contact search that checks the bottom of
the boots and another place chosen at random such as the inside of the
mouth, the belt line or the person's hair; and\
16.48.2 A Full strip or rigorous searches down to underwear in all high
-risk areas and, as and when circumstances may dictate.\
16.49 Where x- ray searching of personnel is conducted, records of x

release in a manner that persons will be routed to safety in a direction
away from the danger area without compromising the high - risk area
security.\
16.54.1 Exit from the high -risk area will as far as possible be into a
safe refuge bay, fully equipped to:\
16.54.1.1 Accommodate personnel during an emergency. The emergency exit
procedure shall be fully auditable. All emergency exits will be alarmed
by the Access Control System and monitored.\
16.54.1.2 Provide a means of CCTV surveillance.\
Guidance -- Personnel Searches\
• Decisions on who should be searched and to what level should be risk
based. Where someone has done something that warrants investigation,
they will undergo a rigorous search. Similarly, the chain of custody
owner in consultation with the Risk Manager (Security) can mandate
increased or decreased levels of full search.\
• This technique provides an opportunity to interact directly with the
person in the search room. This time should be used to assess the
reaction of the facial and body language of the person being searched.
On occasion the time might be used to interview a person rather than
searching them before they are released from the diamond areas. Any such
interactions should result in a report held in the security incident
management system.\
• Consideration should be given to the use of technology to assist in
personnel and equipment searches. Such technology could include
millimetre wave and x -ray scanner s. Searches of Equipment and Rubbish
16.55 Freight handling facilities must be in compliance with the
requirements stipulated in Annex F, Freight handling procedures must be
approved, implemented and regularly reviewed.\
16.56 Red Area Freight Facility (Single Airlock system):\
16.56.1 All red area freight handling activities to and from the
Recovery (XRT and MDR), Sorthouse and DMS concentrate areas shall be via
the Red Area single airlock freight facility.\
16.56.2 The airlock shall form part of the impervious shell and shall be
equip ped with access - controlled roller shutter doors.\
16.56.3 Roller shutter doors shall be equipped with electric motors to
facilitate remote operation of the doors.\
16.57 All equipment and personal effects brought into and taken from
diamond areas will be subject to searc hes.\
16.58 The accountable manager of the diamond areas will approve in
writing, all non -standard equipment (one off introduction of, or
project related equipment) taken into and out of the diamond areas
before it is brought in or taken out.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 65

16.59 A written protocol should dictate the manner in which redundant
equipment should be treated and also specify at what stage equipment
will be considered redundant, in which case the use of it should be
prohibited and the removal of such facilitated.\
16.60 Decisions on what is searched and to what level will be risk based
and recorded in the security incident management system.\
16.61 Where standard tools are frequently required by mechanics,
engineers or electricians, consideration should be given to holding a
set within the diamond area s that does not leave this area.\
16.62 All rubbish and waste from diamond areas will be searched and the
search witnessed (surveillance can act as a witness to this).\
16.63 The waste will be disposed of such that it is not easily
identified as coming from the diamond areas and not easily recovered.\
16.64 Liquid and toilet waste outlets and drainage systems and access to
them will be monitored.\
Guidance -- Searches of E quipment and R ubbish\
• The number of items taken into diamond areas should be minimised and
clearly thought through:\
o Where an item of equipment is needed, consideration should be given to
removing its packaging before entering the diamond areas; and\
o Where appropriate items taken into diamond areas will be searched to
mitigate the risk of substitution.\
• The search equipment might include mirrors on poles, x -ray machines,
dentist mirrors, or other specialist devises as required.

Equipment specifications for procurement purposes - Systems
Obsolescence\
• In the era of Industry 4.0, big data and computing technologies are
driving the future of manufacturing. While these innovations are
extremely valuable for manufacturers, the increasing speed of
technological change also means that equipment c omponents are prone to
quicker obsolescence.\
• According to the definition from the International Institute of
Obsolescence Management (IIOM) , obsolescence is the unavailability of
parts or services that were previou sly available, and usually occurs
when the components of a system are no longer produced by the original
equipment manufacturer (OEM) or when the latter is no longer in
business. This means that when these components break or experience a
malfunction, repl acements can be hard to find.\
• Obsolescence is the by -product of continuous technological advances
and as such it cannot be eliminated completely, especially now that
manufacturers are under more pressure than ever before to digitalise
their facilities. H owever, plant managers should not feel forced to
perform costly systems upgrades every time an obsolete component break.\
• Obsolete does not mean useless or underperforming, and sourcing a like
-for-like replacement can be quick and easy with the help of a s
pecialised supplier. Additionally, in highly regulated industries such
as nuclear and pharmaceutical manufacturing, upgrades also mean realms
of paperwork and red tape, making like - for-like replacements the
easiest choice.\
• This is the basic idea behind managing obsolescence in a manufacturing
facility --- maintaining systems by sourcing obsolete components in a
timely and cost -efficient way. With a proactive obsolescence management
plan in place, legacy equipment can be perfectly integrated into a smart
factory, allowing manufacturers to digitalise their plants while saving
money and reducing their environmental footprint. Let's see how in seven
simple steps.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 72

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
Step 1: System assessment\
o To effectively plan, you'll need to know the present state of yo ur
system by performing a comprehensive system audit. How old is your
machinery and how long have its components been on the market already?\
o Compare your answers with life expectancy data provided by the OEM to
determine the life stage of your machines an d their components, so that
you can have a better idea of how long they will still serve you.
Finally, make a list of components that are already obsolete or are
about to be made obsolete by the OEM.\
Step 2: Resource planning\
o Strategic obsolescence mana gement requires resources. Do you have a
dedicated budget for periodic upgrades and last -time purchases? Can you
afford to hire an obsolescence manager to help you keep track of
components life cycles and plan repairs when needed?\
o Most importantly: do you have partnering agreements with a reliable
automation parts supplier? When obsolete components break, knowing who
to call can make the difference between hours or weeks of costly
downtime.\
Step 3: Risk analysis\
o Critical applications, which are essential to operate the entire
system, are ones you should prioritise when putting together an
obsolescence plan. If a component of these applications broke down, how
much would downtime cost your business? Draw up a risk assessment form
to decide whether you can r isk them breaking down or whether preventive
maintenance is the most convenient option.\
o Analyse how worn their moving parts are, and research whether they are
still available from the OEM or whether there are compatible products on
the market. If they're already obsolete, contact a specialised supplier
to get a quote. Since a failure of these components would impact the
functionality of the overall system, timely replacement might be the way
to avoid unplanned downtime.\
Step 4: Shopping and stocking o Indus trial parts need to be grouped
based on their risk of becoming obsolete. For components that are
already obsolete, evaluate the possibility of stockpiling some spares
while they are still relatively abundant on the market. For end -of-life
(EOL) components, OEMs may send a last -time buy (LTB) notice and even
provide special quotes. This might be the best time to squirrel away
some spares.\
o Do not forget that for larger spare parts you might need to have a
dedicated a space in your warehouse. This space and it s correlated
costs must be accounted for in step two.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 73

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
Step 5: The right supplier\
o Based on your analysis of how critical a part is to your process, the
speed at which it will wear and its risk of becoming obsolete, you
should draw up a plan of where you can source these parts from and how
quickly.\
o For example, if a supplier doesn't regularly hold a specific obsolete
VSD in stock, they'll have to source it from a third party, which could
be located halfway around the world. Working with a specialised
industrial automation parts supplier means you are safe in the knowledge
that when a part does break down, you immediately know who to call to
get your obsolete replacements quickly.\
Step 6: Put ting together a database.\
o All the data collected so far should be recorded and safely stored.
This information is invaluable and collating it into an easy
understandable format could save precious time in case of breakage.\
o This does not necessarily mean investing in an elaborate database. For
small to medium plants, it can be enough to have a clear spreadsheet
detailing the conditions of critical parts, their likelihood of breaking
down, and the contact information of suppliers who have t hem in stock
or can provide them quickly.\
Step 7: Reviewing and updating o Effective obsolescence management is a
full- time job. It takes careful management to keep automated systems
pitch perfect, which is the reason why larger businesses opt for hiring
an obsolescence manager and sometimes even one or more last -time -buy
professional purchasers who are responsible for managing EOL parts.\
o However, smaller plants can go a long way by simply keeping their
spreadsheets updated and organised. Make sure you subs cribe to OEMs'
newsletters to be notified when parts are discontinued and last -time
-buys are available. Plan regular checks to update your spreadsheets,
increasing their frequency for parts that are already visibly worn.\
o By incorporating obsolescence mana gement into maintenance plans,
companies can minimise the impact of breakdowns, eliminating last minute
repairs costs and saving money in the long run.\

Responsibility team to ensure that Voluntary P rinciples on Security and
Human Rights (VPSHR) and CSR programmes are aligned. The Security Team
will assure this review co -ordination occurs at least annually.\
Artisanal Mining 18.13 Where artisanal mining is present on a concession
area the miners will be moved off the area in accordance with the
relevant local laws or regulations and treated with respect for their
humanity. \[Guidance: this is normally a Public Security task, upholding
the rule of law.\] 18.14 Closing artisanal mining pits is a dangerous
activity and all due care and precautions will be taken to ensure that
they are clear of people before they are closed to protect Lucara
Botswana and its employees a sign off process will occur before pit
closure including at least public security, Lucara Botswana security,
and the Mining or Exploration Departments.\

illegality of their mining on the concession area and the implications
of doing this . \[Guidance -- this may be through the regular patrols of
the concession area, community forums, the VPSHR stakeholder engagement
or signage placed across the concession area.\] 18.16 The security risks
and the consequences posed by artisanal miners to the organi sation will
be clearly reflected in the security risk assessment and risk mitigation
strategy.\
Guidance\
• In new operations with significant artisanal mining or complex
community relations operations should consider having a dedicated legal
advisor supportin g the communities and the security teams.\
• Names of security officers contracted by the operation to render
security services as per this standard are to be kept on record together
with proof of compliance in terms of medical fitness, minimum training
achie vements, annual refresher training requirements, scholastic
qualifications, and security clearance status. Verification that only
those who qualify are deployed should be incorporated into the security
reporting framework.\
• Deployment records are to be subm itted daily by the security service
provider for analysis to ensure that only those security officers who
are in compliance with the requirements stipulated in this LDCS are
deployed.

actual reviewing, record keeping and quality management thereof.\
Surveillance Response, Recording and Reporting\
20.12 Where there is any breach of the safety standards and it is
observed in real time, the operator must intervene immediately to
prevent injury and a record of such must be kept, in the official
incident management kept by security.\
20.13 Any safety or security incident whether observed in real time or
focussed review must be recorded in the incident management system by
the individual operator that observes the event.\
20.14 Incident reports will be generated for every instance of a break
into the diamond recovery circuit in high- risk areas. Examples of such
interventions into the diamond recovery circuit include:\
20.14.1 Spillages.\
20.14.2 Clearance of blockages in the recovery process.\
20.14.3 Maintenance events -- unscheduled and scheduled.\

20.14.6 Machine and/or equipment purging.\
20.14.6.1 No human interface in/on diamond recovery machines, equipment,
machine components and/or auxiliary equipment, in high -risk areas
should take place unless clear evidence is provided that t he diamond
recovery machines, equipment and/or auxiliary equipment has been purged
from any and/or all diamond containing material. If this ruling is not
complied with, the incident should be reported and escalated in
accordance with a written protocol.\
20.14.6.2 Should the purging of diamond recovery machines, equipment,
machine components and/or auxiliary equipment in high -risk areas not be
possible prior to human interface with such diamond recovery machines,
equipment, machine components and/or auxiliary equipmen t, authorization
should be obtained through the submission of a deviation request as per
the change management process.\
20.15 Incident reports for high -risk interventions into the diamond
recovery circuit will clearly reflect evidence that incidents were
observe d by surveillance and where necessary, and in according to pre
-set criteria, incidents will be posted for second tier review by a
dedicated team of reviewers.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 86

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
20.16 Should there be clear evidence that high -risk interventions into
the diamond recovery process were not observed by surveillance, an
enquiry and/or investigation should be initiated to determine the
reasons why surveillance was not conducted and to implement measures to
prevent a re -occurrence.\
20.17 The following requirements must be met with regards to the second
tier reviewing of incidents:\
20.17.1 The reviewing process must be governed by a procedure that
includes but need not be limited to:\
20.17.1.1 The type of events, actions or circumstances that will trigger
video review to ensure consistency in application.\
20.17.1.2 The form al record keeping of review findings, follow -up
action and feedback.\
20.17.1.3 The quality assurance, monitoring and closure of reviewed
incidents.\
20.18 There is a methodology or system in place to monitor exposure of
product to human contact, with ongoing intervention t o reduce such,
supported by clearly displayed metrics to measure the effectiveness of
the interventions.\
20.19 Protocols will be developed in tandem with operations to ensure
that surveillance is informed of interventions into the diamond circuit
before the interventions happen.\
20.20 Records of the observations must denote who was involved, what
happened; where it happened; when it happened; why an event happened and
any notable environmental conditions at the time of the event.\
20.21 Incident reporting officers are monitored and supported on an
ongoing basis, and incident reporting is monitored to ensure incident
are complete accurate and reliable so as to ensure g the integrity of
reported data.\
20.22 Mechanisms are in place to ensure that all incidents affecting the
security of the organisation or that may lead to loss to the
organisation are reported.\
Non -Compliance events are clearly defined in the operation's SOPs
comprehensively communicated and clearly displayed, with clearly defined
gu idelines indicating under which circumstances security personnel
should intervene, how to intervene and how to escalate incidents when a
non -conformance event and/or security control failures in high -risk
area are observed. Limits of authority should be clearly specified
Access to Imagery and Data- Protection\
20.23 The Risk Manager (Security) is to ensure that procedures are in
place governing access to imagery and data. Reference will be made to
ensure that data protection protocols are in place stipulating how and
to which location the data is transferred. These procedures must
include:\
20.23.1 Authorisation,\
20.23.2 Dissemination, and\
20.23.3 The recording of decisions and access granted.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 87

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
20.24 The Risk Manager (Security) must grant authorisation to internal
stakeholders to access footage and security data, and records of such
access will be kept in Perspective and the Risk Co-ordinator (
Operational Support) informed. The information recorded should
specifically mention:\
20.24.1 The date of disclosure.\
20.24.2 Who it was disclosed to; a nd 20.24.3 Why it was disclosed.\
20.25 Data and CCTV footage gathered by the surveillance function is
sensitive and is classified Confidential.\
20.26 Procedures include the data storage protocols, and the way in
which access to data is controlled.\
20.27 Detail regarding correct us e of surveillance systems such that it
could not damage the integrity, or the professional reputation of Lucara
Botswana will be included in SOPs and training material.\
20.28 All people entering the mining area, including but not limited to
personnel, contractors and visitors will be made aware and will provide
written consent to monitoring by Surveillance including the use of
CCTV.\
20.29 Transfer of data and imagery between Lucara Botswana companies
must be in accordance with any legal requirements and contractual pro
visions between entities be in place before data is transferred.\
20.30 Data and imagery should be stored and retained for a period to fit
with operational requirements, 17 unless legislation directs a lesser
period.\
20.31 Data and imagery of high -risk activities such as interventions
into the diamond circuit should be stored so that a library can be made
up for future detailed comparison of the same activity.\
This is to provide a sample of efficient and correctly conducted
activities with which to compare future similar activities for
compliance and efficiency.\
20.32 Data and imagery referring to incidents should be backed up and
stored separate from the surveillance suite for as long as local
legislation and capacity allows.\
External Liaison\
20.33 A formal list of external liaison contacts will be compiled and
maintained by the Risk Manager (Security) for all Lucara Botswana
operation s (Karowe Diamond Mine and Corporate Office, Diamond
Technology Park) .\
20.34 Liaison will be structured in accordance with the threat
indicators and the information collection plan.\
\[Guidance for External Liaison -- such liaison contacts will assist the
Risk Manager (Security) form a picture of the local threats and
providers of assistance and as such may include local police commanders,
peer group companies, security providers, custom s officials etc. use of
such external \] The above information could be included in a business
environment scan. The business environment scan forms part of the risk
management process is done once and reviewed annually and forms the
basis for threat identification.\
Guidance\
• Where possible surveillance should be offsite -- at least for review
and assurance.\
• Such off -site assurance should report operationally to the Risk
Manager (Security) but for independence to the Chief Risk Officer and MD
Lucara Botswana.\
• High- risk activitie s should be clearly defined such that a norm can
be established. A norm will provide for consistent actions and movements
when people interact with diamond material. This will assist the
application of the surveillance control.\
• Where regular interventions to the diamond recovery process take place
such as sampling, consideration should be given to the use of
photographs on a single point brief of a correct authorised way to
conduct a sample so that the operator is aware of the correct method and
consistentl y faces the same way with hands in the same position and
completing actions in the same order.\
• The surveillance philosophy is based on pragmatic approach centred
around a three - tier structure namely:\
o First Tier\
o Second Tier\
o Third Tier\
• First Tier:\
o This is t he first level of surveillance which focus on general
surveillance of risk areas. This Level undertakes routine remote
plant/premises patrols and remote escorting and consists of dedicated,
focused and/or real time surveillance.\
• Second Tier:\
o This is the second level of surveillance which concentrates on
identified specific risk elements for detailed information. These
operators target individuals or a group of people (regarded as Hot
People) at risk areas (regarded as Hot Places). They also target risk
processes (regarded as Hot Process) and detect any risk behaviour at
identified areas or process. This second level of surveillance is
triggered by first tier surveillance, supports, consolidates and acts as
an audit structure of First Tier. This level has a responsibility to
archive any deviations or abnormalities on a separate storage material
which must be revisited whenever need arise.\
• Third Tier:\
o This Level of surveillance consist of management and is responsible
for system administration and configuration as well as auditing,
including remote assurance.

MPS 23 -- Investigations into Suspected Wrongdoing\
Intent\
To thoroughly investigate incidents of suspected wrongdoing while
ensuring that any information or evidence collected can be used by
subsequent internal or criminal investigations as required. Incidents
will be recorded, notified to the appropriate people and investigated
correctly to learn lessons for improvement\
Context - Investigations into suspected serious wrongdoing
\[i.e. significant financial loss or the catastrophic failure of
internal controls\] must be treated differently from a simple inquiry.
The outcome of investigations can include dismissal, public trial,
imprisonment for offenders, legal reviews and media attention; as a
result, management of investigations requires particular attention to
local laws, employment regulations, labour relations consequences, Human
right violations and the preservation and continuity of evidence.\
Required Actions\
23.1 The organisation should:\
23.1.1 Develop a procedure that governs the way in which security
investigations are to be conducted, including the administration pr
ocesses and documentation requirements associated with it.\
23.1.2 Obtain management approval and sign -off for the procedure that
governs the way in which security investigations are to be conducted.\
23.1.3 Publish the procedure the way in which security investigations a
re to be conducted on the internalised document repository.\
23.1.4 Communicate the procedure that governs the way in which security
investigations are to be conducted.\
23.1.5 Implement the procedure that governs the way in which security
investigations are to be conduct ed by establishing a monitoring
capability to verify implementation.\
23.1.6 Review the procedure that governs the way in which security
investigations are to be conducted continually to ensure alignment with
business requirements.\
23.2 An escalation procedure and matrix should be included in the
procedure that governs the way in which investigations are to be
conducted to inform the escalation process for significant Security
events.\
23.3 The line manager of the area impacted by the incident is
accountable for producing this notification to the general manager.\
23.4 All incidents of failures in Security will be recorded in the
information reporting system and used for subsequent analysis.\
23.5 Where general issues are identified that lead to losses such as
lower numbers of quality\
Diamonds than expected, less diamond specials than expected, smaller
size distributions than expected by the block model and whose root cause
is unknown the issue will be escalated to the General Manager and
Managing Director as soon as practical and an appropriate ad hoc working
group convened to identify next steps and root causes.

23.6 Security incidents other than those involving Diamonds, such as
theft of company fuel, should be treated in similar ways.\
23.7 In all cases investigations and inquiries will be fair, objective
and thorough, they will:\
23.7.1 analyse the root cause of incidents,\
23.7.2 document the investigations process,\
23.7.3 preserve the continuity of evidence,\
23.7.4 document the investigation results and any follow -up improvement
actions.\
Guidance -- Reserved\
• It is essential to cover Investigations Philosophy which covers:\
o Human Resources Investigations.\
o Operational or Security Procedural Breach or Failure.\
o Suspected Malicious Act.\
o Background or Security Clearance Investigations.\
o Due Diligence Investigations.\
• It is essential to highlight on Investigative process and elaborate on
different stages of investigations, e.g., Preliminary Investigation
which is an initial fact -finding stage of an investigation and is
usually performed at the scene of the incident and may be performed by a
patrolling Security Officer or in high -risk areas a Team Lead.\
• Follow -Up or covert Investigation which is the investigative process
that is performed by the Specialist Investigator, possibly in
conjunction with relevant law enforcement re presentatives and subject
matter experts.\
• For a well- coordinated investigation , before investigation takes
place an investigation strategy should be agreed with the Head of
Department. The agreed investigative strategy will be captured in a
document outlin ing the scope of the investigation.\
• Investigation should be initiated with the formal written
authorisation of the Head of Department . Such authority should be
retained within the case file.\
• Individuals implicated in an allegation of wrongdoing must not
conduct, or be involved in the direction of, an investigation that
relates to them.\
• Working with Government Law Enforcement Agencies\
o Head of Department must approve all operations designed to collect
information that require working closely with Government Law Enforcement
Agencies .\
o The Chief Risk Officer or Managing Director will also be consulted in
the early stages of planning for any such potential operations and in
all cases before they happen.

MPS 25 -- Intelligence\
Intent\
Lucara Botswana is in an advantageous position with respect to Diamond
Intelligence in that the Government of Botswana has a very strong
Criminal Intelligence capability due to the Strategic importance of the
Diamond Industry for Botswana. It is important that Lucara's Security Te
am plays a supportive role to this Government capability and that is
then the intent of this MPS.\
Required Actions\
25.1 Lucara Botswana should have an internal capability to support the
initiatives of Government Diamond Intelligence activities\
25.2 Formal and regular interactions with Government and Local
Authorities should be maintained and record kept of all interactions.\
25.3 Formal meetings should be held at least once per quarter with
Government Intelligence structures to discuss matters of mutual
interest.\
25.4 The MD Lucara should be briefed in detail on the discussions during
these meetings.\
25.5 Regular interactions (at least monthly) should be maintained with
other diamond operations in the region and a formal documented meeting
should be held at least once per quar ter. 25.6 The Risk Manager
(Security) should attend all the meetings with respect to intelligence
and investigations and brief the General Manager on a need -to-know
basis.\
25.7 Persons assigned to the intelligence support activities should
clearly understand that th ey do not have certain jurisdictions outside
of the operational area of the mine and should therefor be careful to
act within the legal framework of the country.\
25.8 The security incident reporting system should be analysed on a
continuous basis to determine s uspicious activities of persons.
Specific attention should be directed to persons that repeatedly
contravene operational procedures.\
25.9 Other systems like the access control system, seal management,

analysis these investigations.

Guidance:\
What is Intelligence?\
Intelligence is the umbrella term referring to the range of activities
-- from planning and information collection to analysis and
dissemination -- aimed at maintaining or enhancing relative security by
providing forewarning of threats or potential threats in a manner that
allows for the timely implementation of a preventive policy or
strategy.18\
The term "intelligence" often conjures the practice of espionage,
thoughts of illicit or covert activities. This is not the context in
which the term "intelligence" it is being utilized or referred to.

18 Peter Gill & Mark Phythian - Intelligence in an Insecure World --
Polity Press 2006

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 100

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
The term "intelligence" here should be considered as t he sum total of
two very distinct actions occurring in harmony with each other.\
Information + Analysis = Intelligence\
"Though often used interchangeably and incorrectly, there is a
difference between information and intelligence. Unprocessed information
helps raise awareness and understanding. When this information is
analyzed and evaluated, it becomes intelligence. Intelligence provides
situational understanding that enables better decision- making.
Information plus analysis equal intelligence. 19 " Being Intelligence
Led is a process that will provide for the Security Department at the
operational level to achieve maximum effectiveness. It provides for an
encompassing organizational approach leveraging on numerous streams of
information allowing for time ly and tactical decision -making and paves
the road for future strategic efforts to maximize resiliency.\
Understanding the Intelligence Cycle20 In efforts to achieve
internalized resilience, one need to fully understand the process, which
must be followed. The process utilized to achieve this goal is referred
to as the Intelligence Cycle.\
These very basic steps must be adhered to which will provide our
Security Efforts to be truly and effectively Intelligence Led.\
The Intelligence Cycle has four Key Processes\
1. Requirements & Planning 2. Collection\
3. Exploitation & Analysis\
4. Dissemination\
Requirements & Planning\
As with any investigation, a starting point is required. The basic
questions that always must be asked and determined are referred to as "W
-5" --- Who? What? When? Where? Why? (...And potentially the most
important and evasive question to be answered is How?)\
The answers to the specific questions will also be utilized as the
starting points for identification of your respective intelligence needs
into requirements of your respective Security Unit. These specific
points will formulate the specific framework for decision makers who
will determine and establish the Essential Elements of Information, and
the planners and the intelligence staff. Typica lly, an individual is
assigned as the Intelligence Resource of the Security Team and will be
responsible for generating the Intelligence Requirements specific to the
Business Unit, driving the production process.\
Once the Intelligence Requirement is defin ed, spawned from internal or
external vulnerabilities, potential threats or pressures, is then
transferred into a Collection Plan. A specific individual quality trait
of the Security Intelligence Resource is to identify the type of person
will determine whether the intelligence produced is responsive to the
user's requirements. Where intelligence is

playing an increasingly important role, the focus is maintained
primarily on the reduction of risk through the identification of
potential vulnerabilities Government intelligence requirements are
expressed in terms of foreign threats to national or international
security. In the business arena, where intelligence is playing an
increasingly important role, requirements will generally be expressed in
terms relating to individuals or groups involved within the illicit
diamond trade.\
Planning encompasses the entire intelligence process, beginning with the
threat assessment phase and culminates with the delivery of the finished
intelligence products. Plans are generat ed that are responsive to known
or anticipated intelligence requirements.\
Collection\
The collection requirement specifies exactly how the intelligence
service will go about acquiring the intelligence information the
customer needs. It is normal for several players in the intelligence
community to be involved in formulating collection requirements.
Collection requirements may be managed by a group of specialists acting
as liaisons between users and the collection resources. In
non-government organizations c ollection management may be relegated to
one person or team within an intelligence or operational security unit.\
Collection requirements management entails much more than simple
administrative duties. It requires analytic skill to evaluate how well
the use r has expressed the need; whether the collection assets are able
to obtain the identified information, and how the collected information
reaches the intelligence analyst.\
Information from open sources are often a valuable collection resource
in the busines s environment, including corporate publications,
advertising, newspapers, periodicals, academic journals, foreign and
domestic broadcasts, official documents and other published material.
Analysts should not participate in any unlawful covert and or clande
stine resources while performing this important collection task.\
Exploitation & Analysis\
Exploitation and analysis involve a series of mental operations various
types of collected information or data with close examination of related
items of information t o determine the extent to which they confirm,
supplement, or contradict each other, and thus establish probabilities,
relationships, and conclusions. Analysts in all operational programs use
their knowledge of regional, national, and global trends to asses s the
quality of all types of information gathered, and organize it into a
responsive, useful intelligence product.\
The purpose of intelligence analysis is to reveal to a specific decision
maker the underlying significance of selected target information. F
requently intelligence analysis involves estimating one possible
outcome, given the many possibilities in a particular scenario. This
function is not prediction although in some cases it might be seen as
such. The analysis typically can involve forecasting , which requires
the analyst to make explicit statements about the degree of confidence
held in a certain set of judgments. There are different levels of
analysis associated with the production process, usually with results in
corresponding levels of concl usions.\
In intelligence analysis, the analyst typically does not have direct
access to the observable subject, but, instead, gathers information from
a variety of sources then proceeds to generating tentative explanations
for a subject activity, event, or phenomenon. Each hypothesis is
examined for plausibility and compared against the acquired information,
in a continual process toward reaching a conclusion. Often the
intelligence analyst tests several hypotheses at the same time,
generating potential scen arios, and testing each using a rigorous
mental processes, subject domain knowledge, experience, and a variety of
other associated background "skills."

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 102

The successful intelligence analyst brings to the discipline:\
• Certain requisite knowledges and abilities,\
• Has necessary aptitude for specialized training,\
• Can perform the specific tasks associated with the job, and\
• Exhibits personality traits compatible with intelligence analysis
work.\
This profile is valid in any setting of intelligence activity.\
The previously described steps of the cycle are necessary precursors to
intelligence production, but it is only in this step that functionality
of the whole process is achieved. Production results in the creation of
intelligence, that is, value -added action able information responsive
to the user's needs. In practical terms, production refers to the
creation, in any medium, of either interim or finished briefings or
reports for use by other analysts, decision makers, or policy officials.
The general productio n principles apply to both government and private
sector intelligence operations.\
Reporting and Dissemination The production of intelligence is without
relative value unless it is timely and reaches the prospective users in
a form that allows exploitation of the intelligence. The business
environment today is extraordinarily dynamic, with the result that
information and intelligence is time sensitive, at highest value at the
time of acquisition and depreciates rapidly from that moment. Actionable
intelligen ce is perishable, although it may serve well as historical
information too. The key, then, is expedited production and
dissemination for action.\
The intelligence process does not end with delivering the product to the
customer. Instead, it continues in wi th dialogue between producer and
user. If the product is to be useful, dissemination involves feedback.
Intelligence producers need feedback from end -users.\
They need to know what is useful and not useful to meet the intelligence
requirements. Then produc ers can modify their practices to further
develop those activities that served the user well and improve or
eliminate those that did not.\
Feedback should include key questions, such as:\
• Is the product usable?\
• Is it timely?\
• Was it in fact used?\
• How was it used?\
• Did the product meet expectations? If not, why not?\
• What next?\
The answers to these questions will lead to refined production, greater
use of intelligence by decision makers, and further feedback sessions.
Thus, production of intelligence generates more requirements in this
iterative process.

Annex A -- Security Primer\
Security is a Weakest Link problem\
Security is the process of reducing risk. Risk is the product of the
probability that something can go wrong and the impact it would have on
the organisation should it go wrong. Security tends to be a 'weak link'
problem where total security is no better than the weakest point in the
organisation. Therefore, it must be evaluated broadly across the entire
organisation to understand where these weak links might be 21. It is not
something done solely by the security function. It is a cross -
functional business process that demands ownership and input from all
parts of the business and visible leadership by line management. The
implications of this for a diamond mine are for the line management to
be conversan t with security issues in their area of operation and for
there to be a simple and effective system for escalating security risks
to the executive.\
Trade -offs involved with Security Programme design\
Security is also a series of trade -offs: the greater the level of
security desired the more administration and controls are required, and
the greater the tendency to reduce ease of use. These trade- offs must
be evaluated . . . with a clear understanding of the issues and a clear
grasp of the personal, financial and reputational risks which only
senior management can provide.\
Therefore, security must be transparent and visible to the senior
management of Lucara Botswana' businesses. An understanding of the costs
of implementing security must be weighed against the value being
protected and the price of having a security incident were the security
measures not implemented.\
Security Concepts\
A common feature of security planning is to achieve defence on depth
through layers of protection. Defence in depth is ac hieved through
mutually supporting layers of control. These are designed to protect
personnel, assets and product.\
The layers of control can be thought of as acting on three levels:\
a. Basic level controls such as physical security and technical
monitoring of the environment, through\
b. supervisory controls which are overlaid with\
c. sound monitoring and governance controls\
Physical Security also uses defence in depth through identifying and
establishing a series of security zones. Generally, each layer is p
rogressively more formidable than the next outer ring. The most critical
aspects of an operation are treated using the most substantial measures.
Layers of protection or defence in depth can also be achieved through
redundancy of capacity, processes and\
procedures.\
Elements of Security\
Security controls must be comprehensive and can only be achieved by
addressing all three of the elements essential in any comprehensive
security programme. These elements are architectural, technical, and
operational, the y must be cohesive and work together by design.\
Architectural elements include pedestrian and vehicular traffic routes
and patterns, set back and standoff distances for explosives and other
aspects of the design, layout and configuration of structures, lig hting
and lines of site such as they affect physical security. On a diamond
mining

operation these will include thoughtful design of the diamond recovery
and handling areas to avoid manual handling and ensuring one directional
flow of Diamonds.\
Technical elements encompass all the security specific devices and
systems, such as barriers, alarms, weapons, radios, and contraband
detectors. The presence of security technology alone does not confer
security and it must be integrated into architectural and oper ational
elements to be effective.\
Operational elements are the people, the policies & procedures that
govern them and their actions.\
It necessarily encompasses all the people that may be on the premises
including employees, visitors and vendors. A foundi ng component of
operational security is a positive security culture whereby everybody in
the organisation makes security and safety their responsibility.\
Objectives of Security Controls\
The three elements of security should be combined and aligned with the
normal business activities of Lucara Botswana and the operating mine to
achieve the broad objectives of security below.\
Intelligence\
Obtain and accurate understanding of the changing nature of various
threats to the business and mine to enhance security provision where
required.\
Deterrence\
Deterrence is the existence or creation of a perception on the part of
the adversary that the probability of a successful attack/incursion on
the target is low. Deterrence could be argued to be a relative value in
that an adversary/intruder may choose one potential target over another
based on the state of the security. As such most elements of deterrence
should be observable and obvious such as physical barriers, presence of
security guards, access control, signage, and lighting, which is
supported by a positive security culture.\
Detection\
Detection is the discovery of an adversary action. It includ es the
sensing of covert or overt actions.\
The measures of effectiveness for the detection function are the
probability of sensing adversary action and the time required for
reporting and assessing the alarm. Technical Systems such as sensors,
alarms and cameras assist in detection as well as a security aware work
force.\
Delay\
Delay is the slowing down of an adversary's progress toward their
target. Increased delay improves the chances of detection and can be
accomplished by people, barriers, locks, and activated delays. The
measure of delay effectiveness is the time required by the adversary
(after detection) to bypass each delay element. Delay before detection
is essentially deterrence.\
Verification / Validation\
An important and often overlooked requirement is to verify any alarms
and make a decision on how to respond. A physical security system should
be designed to make this relatively simple and quick to do.\
Response\
Response consists of the actions taken by the responders to prevent
adversary success. As defined here it could consist of interruption,
communication, and escalation. The measure of response

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 109

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
effectiveness is the time between receipt of a communication of
adversary action and the interruption of the adversary action. 22
Resilience -- activities that reduce the consequences resulting from
incidents\
One of the methods of reducing security risk is through reducing the
consequences of an event should it occur. A simple physical example on
mines is the construction of containment walls in case a storage tank
fails. When thinking of designing a security programme consideration of
resilience should be done early on in conjunction with setting risk
tolerance because it may be tolerable to allow an event to occur knowing
that the consequences were limited than spending a lot on elaborate
countermeasures.\
On diamond mines thought needs to be given to how to design the recovery
and sorting process so as to contain and limit any opportunities for
theft or loss of product as well as to train and exercise for efficient
responses to incidents.\
The Decision to steal -- Perceptions matter\
A significant threat in any precious metals or diamond mine is theft by
the employees. In assessing this and possible countermeas ures it is
worth considering the factors in an individual's decision to steal:\
a. The opportunity to steal -- people are tempted by opportunities over
time. Lucara Botswana' operations need to actively reduce the
opportunities for theft provided by operationa l failures and breaches
in process integrity.\
b. Rational decision making assessing the (perceived):\
i) Risk of being caught\
ii) Likely reward\
iii) Ease of execution\
iv) Likely punishment should they be caught\
An ability to neutralise moral concerns. Proactive efforts by Lucara
Botswana across all activities to prevent a 'them and us' mentality from
developing between management and workers, between the company and the
community, and between the company and the various tiers of government.\
The internal control f ramework adopted by Lucara Botswana operations
needs to influence all of these considerations and consistently act on
the employees' perceptions or risk, reward and moral concerns. As such
it cannot be led by the security department but needs to be a whol e
business activity. For Security to succeed line management must accept
that it is their accountability and that it directly supports
profitability.\
Aim of Lucara Botswana Security\
The aim of security in Lucara Botswana Group is to protect our people, p
roperty, product and reputation. The main effort is the disruption,
deterrence, denial, delay, and detection of systemic theft; and the
appropriate responses if detected.\
Aspects of Diamond Security\
Security can sometimes seem a 'black box of tricks' to line management
that are accountable for its efficient delivery. Security at Lucara
Botswana is based on some simple principles that should

22 The Design and Evaluation of Physical Pr otection Systems (2000) by
Garcia -- a good conceptual basis for Physical Security

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 110

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
usefully inform managements' understanding of the provision of security,
the priority of tasks and focus for effort.\
Risk assessment and management\
Lucara Botswana security is designed to be appropriate to the risks. All
levels of line management and the security organisation should have a
sound and coherent understanding of the risks to personnel, diamond
value, repu tation, and information and how this should drive and
prioritise security activities. Security controls will have clear
objectives for mitigating specific risks.\
Chain of custody accountability\
Line management is accountable for security in their areas an d takes an
active interest in its provision and management. The principle of chain
of custody accountability extends to all personnel that are either
directly or indirectly involved in the diamond recovery, sorting and
sales process. They should understa nd their accountability and
responsibility for the product and their own security and integrity.\
Layers of mutually supporting controls\
Defence in depth is achieved through mutually supporting layers of
control. These are designed to protect our personnel and product. The
layers of control can be thought of as acting on three levels:\
basic level controls such as physical security and technical monitoring
of the environment; through\
supervisory controls which are overlaid with sound monitoring ; and
governa nce controls.\
In the context of a diamond operation with its risk of collusion the
majority of these controls should be the accountability of non -security
personnel and functions such as metallurgy, stock control or human
resources and administered by th em.\
Great care will be taken in designing out points where the failure of
one element seriously compromises the integrity of the whole security
effort. Where such failure points exist, they will be identified,
minimised and adequate risk mitigation put in place.\
Protection at the point of exposure\
The opportunity to access Diamonds should be strictly controlled at the
closest practical point of contact to the diamond product. In effect
this will mean engineering out human intervention during the recovery
process (hands free) and where this is not possible having appropriate
controls in place when there is a requirement to intervene.\
In areas of reconciled product it will involve a combination of:\
individual accountability for ensuring the chain of custody of the
product;\
the establishment of out of tolerance limits for parcel weights; and\
the counting of high value Diamonds.\
Coordination to achieve security\
Given the requirement for functions other than security to own and
administer controls that achieve security, business units will need to
establish a mechanism for coordinating such efforts.\
The Diamonds Control Team and more focussed cross -functional teams
working on joint procedures are likely to be the best mechanism for
achieving this.\
Credibility and respect\
To be effective security needs to be credible to those that would
attempt to undermine it, have the trust of Lucara Botswana Diamonds'
personnel and in turn respect them as individuals. To do this security
measures will be proportionate to the risks, base d on a thorough
understanding of the

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 111

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
control objective and aligned with the business process. All security
measures will be robust, auditable, ethical, and withstand independent
third -party scrutiny.\
Continuous improvement and operational analysis\
Failures of diamond control give an insight into the weaknesses of our
controls and allow remedial action to be taken to close them. Any
failure in diamond control will be recorded and inquired into in order
to improve security.\
Data sources from security system s (and in time relevant operational
systems data) will be collated for analysis. This will be automated as
much as possible. Indicators of illicit activity will be identified and
followed up with increased security focus or other actions designed to
better understand the indicator or mitigate the risk.\
Security control effectiveness will be monitored on a continual basis
and provide management metrics to improve security. The Diamond Control
Committee (DCC) will use this analysis as part of a continuous im
provement approach to preventing failures of security or diamond
controls. In so doing diamond security will pursue operational
excellence.\
Early and effective reconciliation of product\
Early and effective reconciliation of Diamonds allows the quantifying of
losses and focus of security effort. Efforts will be made to make this
reconciliation more accurate and earlier in the process. Out of
tolerance limits (OTL) will be set along the process and any breaches
investigated. Reconciliation might be made to the measures of process
efficiency as well as the expected size distribution from the feed
stock.\
Development of threat intelligence\
Periodic threat assessments will review the external environment and the
illicit diamond trade to inform the application of security controls.\
Governance and Organisation of the security function\
Security personnel are particularly well placed to steal Diamonds
systemically. Lucara Botswana operations will exercise sound governance
of the security function. This governance will be exercised at the
operation through the chain of custody owners and the Diamond Control
Committee (DCC).\
Governance will be executed at the corporate level through:\
a. the Board of Lucara Botswana b. the maintenance and audit of this
Standard\
c. Each diamond operation will have people responsible for the delivery
of security. The team will be led by a Security Manager and have access
to technical, incident inquiry, and risk expertise within the operation\
Terminology\
For the purposes of this document, we ha ve defined adversaries,
threats, vulnerability and risk so as to ensure that we are clear in the
use of this terminology. The choice of definitions is widely accepted
and is as follows:\
Adversary: A single or multiple persons who have the intention, capab
ility and determination to cause injury or damage to an asset or entity.
Adversaries may be internal to the entity (employees), external
(criminal, activists, terrorists) or both because of collusion between
the two.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 112

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
Vulnerability: Any weakness, administrative process, or act or physical
exposure that makes an information asset susceptible to exploit by a
thread.\
Threats: Any potential event or act that could cause loss or damage to
the organisation.\
Risk: Risk has been defined as the "effect of uncertai nty on
objectives". Risk is the product of the probability (or likelihood) of
the threat event occurring and the consequences, which the threat event
may have on the organisation or the asset that is attacked. In its
simplest terms risk can be reduced thr ough acting on reducing the
likelihood of a threat event or reducing the possible consequences of
that event.

Annex B - Risk Criteria\
It is proposed that a 5 X 5 matrix similar to the one below is used.\
CONSEQUENCE LEVEL (IMPACT)\
CONSEQUENCE TYPE (LIKELIHOOD) 1 - Insignificant 2 - Minor 3 - Moderate
4 - High 5 - Major\
RISK RATING\
5 - Almost Certain 11\
(Medium) 16 (Significant) 20 (Significant) 23 (High) 25 (High)\
7 (Medium) 12 (Medium) 17 (Significant) 21 (High) 24 (High) 4 - Likely\
3 - Possible 4 (Low) 8 (Medium) 13 (Significant 18 (Significant) 22

2 - Unlikely 2 (Low) 5 (Low) 9 (Medium) 14 (Significant) 19
(Significant)\
1 - Rare 1 (Low) 3 (Low) 6 (Medium) 10 (Medium) 15 (Significant)\
Apart from the monetary impact, the below criteria could be used to
explain the final impact rating on the 5 X 5 matrix. By making use of
this the risk assessment is truly made security specific.\
ASSESSMENT SCALE -- IMPACT OF THREAT EVENTS (LEVEL OF RISK)\
Qualitative Values Semi - Quantitative Values Description\
Major 5 The threat event could be expected to have or lead to multiple
severe or catastrophic adverse effects on organisational operations,
organisational assets, individuals, other organisations, or the Nation.\
High 4 The threat event could be expected to have or lead to a severe or
catastrophic adverse effect on organisational operations, organisational
assets, individuals, other organisations, or the Nation. A severe or
catastrophic adverse effect means that, f or example, the threat event
might: (I) cause a severe degradation in or loss of mission capability
to an extent and duration that the organisation is not able to perform
one or more of its primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to
organisational a ssets; (iii) result in major financial loss; or (iv)
result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss of
life or serious life -threatening injuries.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 114

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021\
Moderate 3 The threat event could be expected to have or lead to a
serious adverse effect on organisational operations, organisational
assets, individual's other organisations, or the Nation. A serious
adverse effect means that, for example, the threat event might: (I)
cause a significant degradation in mission capability to an e xtent and
duration that the organisation is able to perform its primary functions,
but the effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii)
result in significant damage to organisational assets; (iii) result in
significant financial loss; or ( iv) result in significant harm to
individuals that does not involve loss of life or serious life -
threatening injuries.\
Minor 2 The threat event could be expected to have or lead to a limited
adverse effect on organisational operations, organisational assets,
individuals' other organisations, or the Nation. A limited adverse
effect means that, for example, the threat event might: (I) cause a
degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the
organisation is able to perfo rm its primary functions, but the
effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in
minor damage to organisational assets; (iii) result in minor financial
loss; or (iv) result in minor harm to individuals.\
Insignificant 1 The threat event could be expected to have or lead to a
negligible adverse effect on organisational operations, organisational
assets, individuals other organisations, or the Nation.\
... while the below criteria could be used to explain the vertical scale
on the 5 X 5 matrix that addresses likelihood.\
Probability Rating Semi - Quantitative Values Definition\
Almost Certain 5 The unwanted event has occurred frequently; occurs in
order of 1 or more x per year & is likely to reoccur within 1 year\
Likely 4 The unwanted event has occurred infrequently; occurs in order
of less than 1 x per year & is likely to reoccur within 3 years\
Possible 3 The unwanted event has happened in the business at some time;
or could happen within 10 years\
Unlikely 2 The unwanted event has happened in the business at some time;
or could happen in 30 years\
Rare 1 The unwanted event has never been known to occur in the business;
or it is highly unlikely that it will occur within 30 years\

1. BACKGROUND

Diamond control is a critical leg in the diamond management strategies.
The Diamond Control Committee (hereafter referred to as the "DCC")
exists to give assurance on the risk and control effectiveness as they
relate to diamond control, protection and security, drive the zero loss
objectives and also to ensure appropriate and effective preventative and
detective controls (not just security -related ones) are implemented and
effective. It is in this regard that the DCC meet to discuss ways in
which resources can be managed effectively to prevent diamond loss as
well as give assurance to the business on the progress in the journey
towards zero loss.\

Annex F -- Physical Security Controls\
The operation will implement physical security controls on the basis of
a risk assessment. Unless justified by a risk assessment the following
Physical Security controls will be expected.\
1) Bollards should be used where the high -risk area directly borders t
he perimeter to public spaces or highways entrances to high -risk
areas.\
2) The distance between bollards should not be greater than 1.7 metres
to prevent vehicles ramming the perimeter walls.\
3) Where possible and the high value facility directly borders public
space there should be an appropriate standoff between the bollards and
the building façade.\
4) Perimeter fencing should be used to define and partition high -risk
areas complete with adequate signage warning against unauthorised
access.\
5) Use of bullet resistan t glass (where a transparent barrier exists
between the high -risk area and a public space and there is a risk to
personnel from armed robbery).\
6) Use of perimeter wall reinforcing (where the primary defence to the
high -risk area is the perimeter wall).\
7) Light ing to allow effective CCTV operation and surveillance, where
the high -risk areas require camera coverage:\
8) Consideration should be given to the use of white (metal halide, high
pressure sodium, LED etc.) or yellow (low pressure sodium) light sources
and matching these light sources with that recommended by the CCTV
manufacturer.\
9) The application of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design
(CPTED) which aims to design a facility to remove the risk of crime
through better lighting, clear lines of sight, optimising work areas for
surveillance, etc.;\
10) Vaults will satisfy the insurance requirements and, where these are
not specific, will be rated to achieve a two -hour delay against a
determined and well- equipped adversary.\
11) Vaults will contain (where possible):\
a. Dual custody combination (tumbler type) locks or key combinations;\
b. a tumbl er duress alarm (if tumbler);\
c. a seismic alarm;\
d. a way of detecting motion when the vault is secured (and for activity
when unsecured);\
e. video coverage inside the highest risk areas;\
f. a method of accurately recording the movements of people in and out
of the vault.\
g. Will monitor the status of the door bolt;\
12) Where the vault requires a combination to open it this will be
changed:\
a. at least every twelve months;

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 141

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021

b.  once someone with knowledge of the combination leaves the
    operation's or a role that requires them to open the vault.\

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
13) Fire doors, man -traps, inner doors, outer doors and their locks
    will satisfy the local regulatory requirements and where these are
    insufficient they will satisfy Lucara Botswana safety standards.\
14) The structure and housing of external doors wi ll achieve the time
    delay required of the design. (For example, there is no point having
    a plywood door with a wooden frame fitted with an elaborate lock if
    the desired time delay is 15 minutes against a determined adversary.
    Equally the door frames and i mmediately adjacent wall must be able
    to withstand the same type of force attack that is applied to the
    door.)\
15) Sally ports (see diagram below explaining the concept) will be used
    if vehicles need to enter a Diamond area. If sally ports are
    required they will be subject to surveillance and kept sterile --
    i.e. totally clear and clean.

The sally port doors will be arranged so that both doors cannot open at
the same time without specific, auditable and positive control.\
Fencing plan for Stockyards, Process plants, Recovery and Sort -Houses:\
Stockyards will be fenced with a double fence lin e allowing a no -man
area between the fences.\
The outer fence will be either palisade or tight wire mesh type at least
2.5 metres tall with barbed wire or razor wire on the top giving an
additional 0.5m height. It will also be put 0.5m into the ground. The
outer layer of fencing should be the primary barrier.\
The inner layer of fencing should be tight wire mesh with barbed wire to
a minimum height of 2.5m.\
The distance between the inner fence and the outer fence will be around
4 metres. This space will be kept clear of vegetation and other
impediments to clear vision of the space. The space between the fences
will be covered by CCTV and, at night, with lights.\
On the inside of the inner fence there will be a 2 metre space until a
marking line -- a simple fe nce or berm - to which the stock pile can be
put. This is to prevent the ore material spilling over the inner fence
and also to allow a secure area for drainage behind the security
fencing.

room will be clean, dust free and environmentally controlled.\
Cabling will be neat, labelled and where required use cable ties to
reduce cable tension.\
The picture below is of a security equi pment room and shows some
elements of dust control, cable labelling and neat connections.

Acceptable cabling\
Cabling within high -risk diamond areas will be within tamper resistant
cable ducts.\
Uninterrupted Power Supply\
1) Our technical security systems are dependent on power supply; the UPS
underpins the security system and can be a key point of failure. As such
UPS equipment will:\
a. Be supported by a maintenance contractor with the specialist skills
particular to the UPS type\
b. Have a bypass switch installed in order to allow the UPS to be
disconnected without affecting the secondary load\
c. Have a management interface installed that allows remote management
and enunciation of status and alarm events to the Security Management
System\
d. Generate an alarm if incoming power is lost, another alarm should be
sent when the UPS is nearing the end of battery life

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 146

e.  Only be loaded to approximately 60 per cent of its full load
    capacity\
f.  Be installed in a managed environment where the temperature and
    humidity are main tained to within manufacturer's recommendations\
g.  Be used for approved critical equipment only. This will be checked
    in accordance with the maintenance schedule and recorded as such\
h.  Have controls in place to sequentially shutdown the business
    critical Security Management System servers in an automated and
    ordered way in the event power is lost and the UPS is nearing the
    end of its battery life\
    Input sensors\

```{=html}

```
2)  Seismic detectors and video enabled motion detection on vaults.\
3)  Personal duress sensors in high -risk areas that interface with the
    public.\
4)  Building perimeter activity detectors to annunciate unauthorised
    access where there is a need to receive immediate notification of
    unauthorised access.\
5)  Motion detection and / or acoustic monitoring devices for perimeter
    windows, entrances, and other vulnerable access points such as roof
    spaces.\
6)  Consideration should be given to asset tracking equipment on high
    value packages within operations such as diamond trolleys, trays and
    parcels. Such asset tracking might be achiev ed through RFiD.\
7)  Cameras will be placed based on the risk requirement and only after
    input has been received from security operations, intelligence, and
    the technical security teams;\

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  Fixed or automatic motion tracking Pan Tilt and Zoom (PTZ) HD Wide
    Angle (180 or similar) cameras will be used in preference to
    manually operated PTZ cameras -- this is to reduce the requirement
    for real time monitoring and direction of the cameras, and to
    prevent intentional changing of the arc of view away from
    activities;\
b.  Cam eras of the following types and attribute combination will be
    considered according to operational requirements:\

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
i)  Thermal imaging type\
ii) High definition type\
iii) Pan Tilt and Zoom (PTZ) type are to be avoided where possible. If
     they are used: they should be housed in domes that obscure the
     direction of the camera from those being observed\
iv) Cameras capable of capturing useable images in day and night
    conditions

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 147

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021

8)  Image collection (the image rate per second and the level of
    resolution) will be considered as part of the CCTV system design.
    The table below defines the minimum requirement for a given level of
    risk:\
    Risk Minimum Viewing Stream from Camera Minimum Background recording
    rate Minimum Motion Recording rate\
    High -risk (Gem Handling Areas) 25IPS PAL,\
    25IPS NTSC 5IPS 13IPS PAL,\
    15IPS NTSC\
    Moderate Risk 13IPS PAL,\
    15IPS NTSC 2IPS 5 -- 10IPS\
    Low Risk 13IPS PAL,\
    15IPS NTSC Optional 5IPS

9)  CCTV video analytics should be considered where appropriate as a
    trigger for surveillance or supervisory follow up and if used will
    be integrated with the Security Management System.\

10) Biometric readers will be installed on entry and exits from diamond
    areas and should be considered for internal doors that partition
    higher risk areas within a diamon d area and require access
    control.\

11) Equipment should be placed with consideration of how it is accessed
    for repair and maintenance.

Annex H -- Security and Human Rights\
Lucara Botswana is committed to observing the Voluntary Principles on
Security and Human Rights (VPSHR). The secretariat of the VPSHR provides
useful information on their implementation on their website. The
Implementation Guidance Tool is particularly useful and can be found at
23: http://www.voluntaryprinciples.org/wp
-content/uploads/2013/03/VPs_IGT_Final_13 -09-11.pdf\
The text of the United Nations sponsored Voluntary Principles on
Security and Human Rights (VPSHR) is below. The members of the Diamond
Control Committee of high -risk operations ( i.e., alluvial miners, post
conflict areas, use of armed police or other pub lic security) should
read the text to understand the intent behind the principles and ensure
they are observed at their sites. Subsequent codes have incorporated the
VPSHR and added to them, in requiring a grievance mechanism to be in
place in the event o f a complaint.\
Appendix 1 to Annex H - Text of the Voluntary Principles on Security and
Human Rights\
Introduction\
Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom, companies in
the extractive and energy sectors ("Companies"), and non -governmental
organizations ("NGOs"), all with an interest in human rights and
corporate social responsibility, have engaged in a dialogue on security
and human rights.\
The participants recognize the importance of the promotion and
protection of human rights throughout the world and the constructive
role business and civil society --- including non -governmental
organizations, labour/trade unions, and local communities --- can play
in advancing these goals. Through this dialogue, the participants have
developed the following se t of voluntary principles to guide Companies
in maintaining the safety and security of their operations within an
operating framework that ensures respect for human rights and
fundamental freedoms. Mindful of these goals, the participants agree to
the impo rtance of continuing this dialogue and keeping under review
these principles to ensure their continuing relevance and efficacy.\
Risk Assessment\
The ability to assess accurately risks present in a Company's operating
environment is critical to the security of personnel, local communities
and assets; the success of the Company's short and long- term
operations; and to the promotion and protection of human rights.\
In some circumstances, this is relatively simple; in others, it is
important to obtain extensive background information from different
sources; monitoring and adapting to changing, complex political,
economic, law enforcement, military and social situations; and
maintaining productive relations with local communities and government
officials.\
The quality of complicated risk assessments is largely dependent on the
assembling of regularly updated, credible information from a broad range
of perspectives --- local and national governments, security firms,
other companies, home governments, multilater al institutions, and civil
society knowledgeable about local conditions. This information may be
most effective when shared to the fullest extent possible

23 The website http://www.voluntaryprinciples.org/resources/ as accessed
on 10th May 2016.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 149

(bearing in mind confidentiality considerations) between Companies,
concerned civil society, and gove rnments.\
Bearing in mind these general principles, we recognize that accurate,
effective risk assessments should consider the following factors:\
• Identification of security risks. Security risks can result from
political, economic, civil or social factors. Moreover, certain
personnel and assets may be at greater risk than others. Identification
of security risks allows a Company to take measures to minimize risk and
to assess whether Company actions may heighten risk.\
• Potential for violence. Depending on the environment, violence can be
widespread or limited to particular regions, and it can develop with
little or no warning. Civil society, home and host government
representatives, and other sources should be consulted to identify risks
presented by the poten tial for violence. Risk assessments should
examine patterns of violence in areas of Company operations for
educational, predictive, and preventative purposes.\
• Human rights records. Risk assessments should consider the available
human rights records of public security forces, paramilitaries, local
and national law enforcement, as well as the reputation of private
security. Awareness of past abuses and allegations can help Companies to
avoid recurrences as well as to promote accountability. Also,
identificati on of the capability of the above entities to respond to
situations of violence in a lawful manner (i.e., consistent with
applicable international standards) allows Companies to develop
appropriate measures in operating environments.\
• Rule of law. Risk asse ssments should consider the local prosecuting
authority and judiciary's capacity to hold accountable those responsible
for human rights abuses and for those responsible for violations of
international humanitarian law in a manner that respects the rights o f
the accused.\
• Conflict analysis. Identification of and understanding the root causes
and nature of local conflicts, as well as the level of adherence to
human rights and international humanitarian law standards by key actors,
can be instructive for the de velopment of strategies for managing
relations between the Company, local communities, Company employees and
their unions, and host governments.\
• Equipment transfers. Where Companies provide equipment (including
lethal and non -lethal equipment) to public or private security, they
should consider the risk of such transfers, any relevant export
licensing requirements, and the feasibility of measures to mitigate
foreseeable negative consequences, including adequate controls to
prevent misappropriation or divers ion of equipment which may lead to
human rights abuses. In making risk assessments, companies should
consider any relevant past incidents involving previous equipment
transfers.\
Interactions Between Companies and Public Security\
Although governments have t he primary role of maintaining law and
order, security and respect for human rights, Companies have an interest
in ensuring that actions taken by governments, particularly the actions
of public security providers, are consistent with the protection and pro
motion of human rights.\
In cases where there is a need to supplement security provided by host
governments, Companies may be required or expected to contribute to, or
otherwise reimburse, the costs of protecting Company facilities and
personnel borne by pu blic security. While public security is expected
to act in a manner consistent with local and national laws as well as
with human rights standards and international humanitarian law, within
this context abuses may nevertheless occur.

Lucara Diamond Control Standard (LDCS) \| 150

© Blindside Ltd / Assurance Protection Group Inc. 2021

In an effort to reduce the risk of such abuses and to promote respect
for human rights generally, we have identified the following voluntary
principles to guide relationships between Companies and public security
regarding security provided to Companies:\
Security Arrangements\
• Companies should consult regularly with host governments and local
communities about the impact of their security arrangements on those
communities.\
• Companies should communicate their policies regarding ethical conduct
and human rights to public security pr oviders, and express their desire
that security be provided in a manner consistent with those policies by
personnel with adequate and effective training.\
• Companies should encourage host governments to permit making security
arrangements transparent and acc essible to the public, subject to any
overriding safety and security concerns.\
Deployment and Conduct\
The primary role of public security should be to maintain the rule of
law, including safeguarding human rights and deterring acts that
threaten Company pe rsonnel and facilities. The type and number of
public security forces deployed should be competent, appropriate and
proportional to the threat.\
• Equipment imports and exports should comply with all applicable law
and regulations. Companies that provide equi pment to public security
should take all appropriate and lawful measures to mitigate any
foreseeable negative consequences, including human rights abuses and
violations of international humanitarian law.\
• Companies should use their influence to promote the following
principles with public security: (a) individuals credibly implicated in
human rights abuses should not provide security services for Companies;
(b) force should be used only when strictly necessary and to an extent
proportional to the threat; and (c) the rights of individuals should not
be violated while exercising the right to exercise freedom of
association and peaceful assembly, the right to engage in collective
bargaining, or other related rights of Company employees as recognized
by the Unive rsal Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO Declaration on
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\
• In cases where physical force is used by public security, such
incidents should be reported to the appropriate authorities and to the
Company. Where forc e is used, medical aid should be provided to injured
persons, including to offenders.\
Consultation and Advice\
• Companies should hold structured meetings with public security on a
regular basis to discuss security, human rights and related work -place
safety issues. Companies should also consult regularly with other
Companies, host and home governments, and civil soc iety to discuss
security and human rights. Where Companies operating in the same region
have common concerns, they should consider collectively raising those
concerns with the host and home governments.\
• In their consultations with host governments, Compani es should take
all appropriate measures to promote observance of applicable
international law enforcement principles, particularly those reflected
in the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Basic
Principles on the Use of Force and F irearms.

• Companies should support efforts by governments, civil society and
multilateral institutions to provide human rights training and education
for public security as well as their efforts to strengthen state
institutions to ensure accountability and respect for human rights.\
Responses to Human Rights Abuses\
• Companies should record and report any credible allegations of human
rights abuses by public security in their areas of operation to
appropriate host government authorities. Where appropriate, Comp anies
should urge investigation and that action be taken to prevent any
recurrence.\
• Companies should actively monitor the status of investigations and
press for their proper resolution.\
• Companies should, to the extent reasonable, monitor the use of equipme
nt provided by the Company and to investigate properly situations in
which such equipment is used in an inappropriate manner.\
• Every effort should be made to ensure that information used as the
basis for allegations of human rights abuses is credible and based on
reliable evidence. The security and safety of sources should be
protected. Additional or more accurate information that may alter
previous allegations should be made available as appropriate to
concerned parties.\
Interactions Between Companies and P rivate Security\
Where host governments are unable or unwilling to provide adequate
security to protect a Company's personnel or assets, it may be necessary
to engage private security providers as a complement to public
security.\
• In this context, private security may have to coordinate with state
forces, (law enforcement, in particular) to carry weapons and to
consider the defensive local use of force. Given the risks associated
with such activities, we recognize the following voluntary principles to
guide p rivate security conduct:\
• Private security should observe the policies of the contracting
Company regarding ethical conduct and human rights; the law and
professional standards of the country in which they operate; emerging
best practices developed by indus try, civil society, and governments;
and promote the observance of international humanitarian law.\
• Private security should maintain high levels of technical and
professional proficiency, particularly with regard to the local use of
force and firearms.\
• Private security should act in a lawful manner. They should exercise
restraint and caution in a manner consistent with applicable
international guidelines regarding the local use of force, including the
UN Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement
Officials and the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, as
well as with emerging best practices developed by Companies, civil
society, and governments.\
• Private security should have policies regarding appropriate conduct
and the local u se of force (e.g., rules of engagement). Practice under
these policies should be capable of being monitored by Companies or,
where appropriate, by independent third parties. Such monitoring should
encompass detailed investigations into allegations of abusive or
unlawful acts; the availability of disciplinary measures sufficient to
prevent and deter; and procedures for reporting allegations to relevant
local law enforcement authorities when appropriate.

• All allegations of human rights abuses by private secur ity should be
recorded. Credible allegations should be properly investigated. In those
cases where allegations against private security providers are forwarded
to the relevant law enforcement authorities, Companies should actively
monitor the status of inv estigations and press for their proper
resolution.\
• Consistent with their function, private security should provide only
preventative and defensive services and should not engage in activities
exclusively the responsibility of state military or law enforcem ent
authorities. Companies should designate services, technology and
equipment capable of offensive and defensive purposes as being for
defensive use only.\
• Private security should (a) not employ individuals credibly implicated
in human rights abuses to provide security services; (b) use force only
when strictly necessary and to an extent proportional to the threat; and
(c) not violate the rights of individuals while exercising the right to
exercise freedom of association and peaceful assembly, to engage in
collective bargaining, or other related rights of Company employees as
recognized by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\
• In cases where physical force is used, private security sho uld
properly investigate and report the incident to the Company. Private
security should refer the matter to local authorities and/or take
disciplinary action where appropriate. Where force is used, medical aid
should be provided to injured persons, includ ing to offenders.\
• Private security should maintain the confidentiality of information
obtained as a result of its position as security provider, except where
to do so would jeopardize the principles contained herein.\
To minimize the risk that private security exceeds their authority as
providers of security, and to promote respect for human rights
generally, we have developed the following additional voluntary
principles and guidelines:\
• Where appropriate, Companies should include the principles outlined
abo ve as contractual provisions in agreements with private security
providers and ensure that private security personnel are adequately
trained to respect the rights of employees and the local community. To
the extent practicable, agreements between Companies and private
security should require investigation of unlawful or abusive behaviour
and appropriate disciplinary action. Agreements should also permit
termination of the relationship by Companies where there is credible
evidence of unlawful or abusive beha viour by private security
personnel.\
• Companies should consult and monitor private security providers to
ensure they fulfil their obligation to provide security in a manner
consistent with the principles outlined above. Where appropriate,
Companies should seek to employ private security providers that are
representative of the local population.\
• Companies should review the background of private security they intend
to employ, particularly with regard to the use of excessive force. Such
reviews should include an assessment of previous services provided to
the host government and whether these services raise concern about the
private security firm's dual role as a private security provider and
government contractor.\
• Companies should consult with other Co mpanies, home country
officials, host country officials, and civil society regarding
experiences with private security. Where appropriate and lawful,
Companies

should facilitate the exchange of information about unlawful activity
and abuses committed by private security providers.

Appendix 2 to Annex H -- Model VPSHR Clauses for Contracts\
Taken from the Voluntary Principles website:
www.voluntaryprinciples.org/resources\
Introduction\
The Voluntar y Principles Initiative has adopted model clauses for use
in security agreements between Government Security Forces and companies
in the extractive and energy sectors ("Companies").24 They are designed
to be used together or individually, but all reflect d ifferent aspects
of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights as they relate
to Government Security Forces. The VPI strongly recommends that its
Government and Company members include these model clauses or similar
variations thereof in securit y agreements that VPI member Government /
Security Forces enter into with VPI member Companies, when relevant and
applicable. The VPI encourages non -member Governments and extractive
and energy sector Companies who seek to create a security framework that
ensures respect for human rights related to Government Security Forces,
to consider these or similar clauses for inclusion in their security
agreements.\
