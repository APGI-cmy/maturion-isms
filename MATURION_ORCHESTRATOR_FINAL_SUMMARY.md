## What Happens Next

### Phase 3: Initial Specialist Creation (MVP Trio)

**Objective:** Create first 3 specialist agents

**Deliverables:**
1. `.github/agents/risk-platform-agent.md`
2. `.github/agents/mat-specialist.md`
3. `.github/agents/criteria-generator-agent.md`
4. Knowledge bases for each specialist
5. Register all 3 specialists in `maturion-agent` specialist-registry.md
6. Add routing rules to `maturion-agent` routing-rules.md

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ Phase 1 complete (governance canon files)
- ✅ Phase 2 complete (Maturion orchestrator agent)
- ⏳ Phase 3 pending (awaiting CS2 authorization via new issue)

---

### Phase 4: Integration Testing

**Objective:** Validate orchestrator + specialist pattern end-to-end

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Transparent delegation (user asks MAT question → Maturion calls mat-specialist, visible)
2. Invisible delegation (user requests report → Maturion calls specialists, seamless)
3. Multi-specialist chain (user imports LDCS + requests risk heat map → criteria-generator → mat-specialist → risk-platform-agent)
4. Cross-app context (user works in MAT, switches to PIT → Maturion maintains session continuity)
5. Watchdog validation (specialist returns cross-tenant data → Guardian blocks, escalates)

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. ONE Maturion vs. Separate Agents Per App
**Decision:** ✅ ONE Maturion orchestrator for ALL apps (MAT, PIT, XDETECT, Builder, Command)

**Rationale:**
- Constitutional requirement (`Maturion/maturion-identity.md`: "ONE intelligence, ONE memory framework")
- Cross-app learning (insights from MAT apply to PIT)
- Unified user experience (seamless app switching)
- Operational simplicity (one orchestrator to maintain, not N)

---

### 2. Transparent vs. Invisible Delegation Default
**Decision:** ✅ **Transparent by default** for novel domain expertise, **invisible for mechanical tasks**

**Criteria:**
- Novel domain expertise → Transparent ("Let me consult the Risk Platform Agent...")
- Mechanical/operational → Invisible (user sees final result only)

---

### 3. Specialist Knowledge Base Independence
**Decision:** ✅ Specialists have **independent knowledge bases**, coordinated via orchestrator

**Rationale:**
- No cross-contamination (mat-specialist doesn't learn threat taxonomy from risk-platform-agent)
- Clear domain boundaries (Arbiter enforces)
- Scalable (add new specialist without touching existing knowledge bases)
