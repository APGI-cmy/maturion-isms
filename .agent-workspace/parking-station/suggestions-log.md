| 2026-02-24 | foreman-v2 | session-wave4-RCA | Add AAWP deliverable table line-by-line tick-off as a mandatory PREHANDOVER gate step — never raise a wave PR without it | `session-wave4-RCA-20260224.md` |
| 2026-02-24 | foreman-v2 | session-053 | Add CI check that fails the PR when .agent-admin/prehandover/proof-*.md is absent to enforce PREHANDOVER completion as a hard gate (prevents Phase 4 omission repeat) | `session-053-20260224.md` |

| 2026-02-24 | foreman-v2 | wave4-cs2-final | Governance hygiene: FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md has entries A-01 and A-18..A-21 only — confirm A-02 through A-17 either exist in a prior session file and are referenced, or consolidate all rules into this file | `proof-wave4-20260224.md` |
| 2026-02-24 | governance-liaison-isms | session-018 | PRE_BUILD_REALITY_CHECK_CANON.md (87119743814a) confirmed layered and verified; ripple PRs #473/#474/#475 triple-triggered — scheduled workflow idempotency still needs improvement | session-018-20260224.md |
| 2026-02-24 | foreman-v2 | wave5-polc-RCA | Add CI POLC boundary gate that fails PR when foreman-v2 is listed as author of production code file changes (outside designated governance evidence paths) — machine-level enforcement of A-001 | `session-wave5-polc-RCA-20260224.md` |
| 2026-02-24 | foreman-v2 | wave5-polc-RCA | Add pre-session verification hook to confirm FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md was loaded and all incidents are REMEDIATED before any task processing begins — prevents Phase 1 Wake-Up bypass | `session-wave5-polc-RCA-20260224.md` |

| 2026-02-24 | independent-assurance-agent | session-026 | SESSION-END | Merge gate failed on invalid sync_state.json JSON syntax (unresolved git conflict markers) — canon update #1201 incoming to enforce local parity checks pre-handover. | `session-026-20260224.md` |
| 2026-02-24 | governance-liaison-isms | session-019 | UNIVERSAL_FAIL_ONLY_ONCE_POLICY.md (4978b0080e6c) layered and verified; governance-liaison-isms FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry created; all agents must now have FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md in knowledge/ dir — validate during PR reviews | session-019-20260224.md |
| 2026-02-25 | foreman-v2-agent | lesson-learned-iaa-omission | Add cross-reference gate to non-negotiables checklist: every mandatory Phase 4 action must have a corresponding YAML capability declaration — prevents YAML-vs-phase-body desync (derived from INC-IAA-OMISSION-20260225) | `lesson-learned-iaa-omission-20260225.md` |
| 2026-02-25 | qa-builder | session-001 | [SESSION-END] | Wave 5 RED-gate tests delivered — builder contract compliance (Phase 1/2/4) was initially skipped and corrected on re-delegation; locked-in learning recorded in lessons-learned.md | session-001-20260225.md |

| 2026-02-25 | independent-assurance-agent | session-001 | Phase 4 verdict | Add CI YAML consistency check verifying identity.lock_id (YAML) matches **Lock ID** reference in LOCKED body section — would auto-catch Lock ID mismatch found in all five builder contracts without manual audit | `session-001-20260225.md` |
| 2026-02-25 | independent-assurance-agent | session-001 | Phase 4 verdict | Four-phase contract upgrade process should include post-upgrade diff against CodexAdvisor-agent.md YAML structure to catch missing governance fields (governance.version, identity.role/mission/class_boundary) before merging | `session-001-20260225.md` |
| 2026-02-25 | independent-assurance-agent | session-002 | Phase 4 post-verdict | Standardise builder preflight attestation format to YAML across all builder classes — improves IAA scriptability and deterministic verification | session-002-20260225.md |
| 2026-02-25 | independent-assurance-agent | session-002 | Phase 4 post-verdict | Codify PREHANDOVER token update ceremony — IAA token reference appended to PREHANDOVER proof before PR open, closing the artifact bundle integrity loop | session-002-20260225.md |

| 2026-02-25 | foreman-v2-agent | session-055 | [SESSION-END] | Standardise builder session memory preflight attestation to YAML format across all builders (IAA A-F-1) — api-builder used prose, qa-builder used YAML; both valid but inconsistent | session-055-20260225.md |
| 2026-02-25 | foreman-v2-agent | session-055 | [SESSION-END] | Codify IAA audit token update as a formal step in the handover process — currently done ad-hoc after IAA verdict (IAA A-F-2) | session-055-20260225.md |
| 2026-02-25 | CodexAdvisor-agent | session-030 | DRAFT-PHASE | Add FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-001/A-002 as a BLOCKING gate at Phase 4 Step 4.4: before opening any PR touching .github/agents/*.md, verify IAA invoked + PREHANDOVER proof + session memory — if any missing, STOP | `session-030-20260225.md` |
| 2026-02-25 | CodexAdvisor-agent | session-030 | SESSION-END | Add S4-01 gate to agent-file-non-negotiables-checklist.md: evidence bundle completeness (IAA evidence + PREHANDOVER + session memory) is BLOCKING before PR open — prevents same-session A-001 create + A-001 violate pattern | `session-030-20260225.md` |
| 2026-02-25 | independent-assurance-agent | session-002 | Phase 4 verdict | Add dual-gate enforcement in CodexAdvisor Phase 2 (plan) and Phase 4 (verify): AGCFPP-001 path guard fires if any .github/agents/*.md is in scope — IAA invocation must be planned upfront, not deferred | `session-002-20260225.md` |
| 2026-02-25 | independent-assurance-agent | session-002 | SESSION-END | Evidence bundle completeness (PREHANDOVER + session memory + IAA evidence) should be CI-enforced, not manual checklist — prevents bundle omission at PR submission time regardless of agent compliance | `session-002-20260225.md` |
| 2026-02-26 | qa-builder | session-wave7-red-20260226 | Wave 7 RED gate delivered — PerplexityAdapter import is the single-file RED trigger; when api-builder creates PerplexityAdapter.ts both wave7-cst.test.ts and ProviderAdapter.contract.test.ts will immediately become loadable and GREEN | session-wave7-red-20260226.md |
| 2026-02-25 | api-builder | session-wave7-20260225 | Consider codifying the FetchFn export requirement as a mandatory pattern in adapter architecture docs to prevent future omissions | session-wave7-20260225.md |
| 2026-02-25 | CodexAdvisor-agent | session-031 | SESSION-END | Add `wc -c` character count check as an explicit BLOCKING step in Phase 3 Step 3.8 merge gate parity script — prevents contract-not-read-first from silently bypassing the 30K limit check | `session-031-20260225.md` |
| 2026-02-25 | CodexAdvisor-agent | session-031 | SESSION-END | Add A-013 character count check to agent-file-non-negotiables-checklist.md as S1-01a: "run wc -c on target file; confirm ≤ 30,000 — BLOCKING" — makes it a QP gate not just a FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule | `session-031-20260225.md` |
| 2026-02-25 | CodexAdvisor-agent | session-032 | SESSION-END | Three-peat process violation (PR #546, #553, #557): add mandatory IAA+bundle checklist to Copilot task prompt for agent contract work — moves enforcement from agent-internal (skipped) to task-external (enforced) | `session-032-20260225.md` |
| 2026-02-25 | CodexAdvisor-agent | session-032 | SESSION-END | Add CI pre-merge check for PREHANDOVER proof and session memory presence in branch — makes fourth process violation structurally impossible without CS2 override | `session-032-20260225.md` |
| 2026-02-25 | independent-assurance-agent | session-003 | PHASE_A_ADVISORY verdict | PR #557 codifies the PREHANDOVER token update ceremony and itself arrived without ceremony performed — real-world first execution of Step 4.3b as part of retroactive remediation | `session-003-20260225.md` |
| 2026-02-25 | CodexAdvisor-agent | session-034 | SESSION-END | Fourth consecutive BOOTSTRAP DIRECTIVE violation: CI gate (session-033) is now the structural enforcement layer — validate that preflight-evidence-gate.yml passes with session-034 evidence artifacts | session-034-20260225.md |
| 2026-02-25 | CodexAdvisor-agent | session-034 | SESSION-END | Add PREHANDOVER proof presence check to CI gate alongside session memory check — closes remaining gap in structural enforcement (per session-033 suggestion) | session-034-20260225.md |
| 2026-02-25 | CodexAdvisor-agent | session-036 | SESSION-END | Sixth consecutive BOOTSTRAP DIRECTIVE violation: governance-liaison-isms-agent.md was delivered at 32,538 chars (over 30,000 limit) without char count check — Phase 3.8 merge gate parity check must be executed before every PR open, including against the file being updated by the PR | session-036-20260225.md |
| 2026-02-25 | CodexAdvisor-agent | session-036 | SESSION-END | Enforce character count check A-013 on the governance-liaison-isms-agent.md in the same CI gate as CodexAdvisor — all .github/agents/*.md files should be covered by the char count gate | session-036-20260225.md |
| 2026-02-25 | governance-liaison-isms | session-036 | ALIGNMENT | First governance-liaison-isms contract update to v3.2.0: Tier 2 scripts created and inline bash removed from contract body as S4 compliance; session-memory-template.md added to Tier 2 to hold verbose templates out of Tier 1 | session-036-20260225.md |
| 2026-02-25 | foreman-v2-agent | session-056 | [BREACH-CORRECTION] | GOV-BREACH-AIMC-W8-001: Wave 8 self-implementation reverted (3rd occurrence same root cause); S-007 CI POLC gate is CRITICAL PRIORITY — machine enforcement of A-001 is structurally required | session-056-20260225-POLC-BREACH.md |
| 2026-02-25 | foreman-v2-agent | session-057 | [SESSION-END] | Delegation pre-authoring pattern (foreman writes builder delegation spec before CS2 wave-start) proved effective — codify in AAWP template for future module builds to minimise latency between CS2 authorization and builder start | session-057-20260225.md |
| 2026-02-25 | independent-assurance-agent | session-wave8-20260225 | Phase 4 | Suggest foreman-v2 PREHANDOVER proof distinguish iaa_deployment_status from iaa_audit_token to avoid placeholder/real token ambiguity | session-wave8-20260225.md |

| 2026-02-26 | independent-assurance-agent | session-007 | Phase 4 | Foreman PREHANDOVER bundle completeness table should explicitly list governance workspace files (PREHANDOVER proof, session memory) as required committed artifacts | session-007-20260226.md |
| 2026-02-26 | foreman-v2-agent | session-058 | [SESSION-END] | Builder agent preflight (reading own contract) must be explicitly stated in every delegation spec — not assumed. Codify mandatory preamble line in delegation spec template in .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/ | session-058-20260226.md |
| 2026-02-26 | foreman-v2-agent | session-058 | [SESSION-END] | Schema SQL verification via file-read+regex is reusable pattern — consider schema-test-template.ts for future migration waves | session-058-20260226.md |
| 2026-02-26 | independent-assurance-agent | session-007 | Phase 4 | IAA token reservation slot (iaa_audit_token: PENDING) in PREHANDOVER works well as coordination mechanism — consider formalising as named protocol in Foreman contract (IAA token reservation pattern) | session-007-20260226.md |
