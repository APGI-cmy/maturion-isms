# Foreman Session Memory — Wave 5.5 QA-to-Red Omission Learning

**Session ID**: 011  
**Date**: 2026-02-16  
**Agent**: foreman-isms  
**Session Type**: Governance Learning and Remediation Documentation  
**Issue Context**: [#242](https://github.com/APGI-cmy/maturion-isms/issues/242) — Wave 5.5 QA-to-Red Omission: Critical Learning and Tracker Update (MAT Frontend)

---

## Session Objective

Document the Wave 5.5 QA-to-Red omission governance learning event in BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md and Implementation Plan, ensuring permanent institutional memory of the "code-first violation" incident and preventive measures.

---

## Context

### What Happened

PR [APGI-cmy/maturion-isms#239](https://github.com/APGI-cmy/maturion-isms/pull/239) attempted to begin frontend implementation for Wave 5.5 (Frontend Application Assembly) WITHOUT first generating and committing a QA-to-Red functional test suite for MAT frontend features. This violated BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md's canonical workflow: **Architecture → QA-to-Red → Build-to-Green → Validation**.

### Critical Governance Learning

**CODE-FIRST VIOLATION STOPS WORK — TEST-FIRST GUARANTEE ENABLES NON-DESTRUCTIVE BUILD**

This is the defining difference between mature and "normal coder" delivery. Test suite MUST precede implementation. Code-first is never permitted in this governance system.

### Timeline

1. **2026-02-16 (earlier)**: Wave 5.5 added to Implementation Plan v1.3.0 (Issue #234, addressing Deviation #9: "Tested ≠ Delivered")
2. **2026-02-16**: ui-builder recruited to scaffold `apps/mat-frontend/` (Issue #237)
3. **2026-02-16**: PR #239 submitted with frontend code changes
4. **2026-02-16**: **CRITICAL GAP DETECTED** — No QA-to-Red test suite for Wave 5.5 frontend functionality
5. **2026-02-16**: **PR #239 STOPPED** — Closed without merge upon detection
6. **2026-02-16**: Issue #240 created — "Wave 5.5 QA-to-Red Functional Test Suite"
7. **2026-02-16**: PR #241 delivered — QA-to-Red suite committed (6 new tests RED, 98 existing tests GREEN preserved)
8. **2026-02-16 (current)**: Issue #242 — Document deviation, update tracker, enhance Implementation Plan

## Actions Taken

### 1. BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md Update

**Location**: `modules/mat/BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`

**Changes Made**:
- Added **Deviation #10: QA-to-Red Omission for Wave 5.5 Frontend — Code-First Violation (2026-02-16)**
- Documented the complete incident timeline (PR #239 stopped, Issue #240 created, PR #241 delivered)
- Recorded 5-Why root cause analysis
- Documented corrective actions (all completed ✅)
- Documented preventive actions for future waves
- Recorded status: **REMEDIATED** (2026-02-16)
- Captured lessons learned: "Code-first is NEVER permitted — Even for remediation waves added post-architecture"

**Key Deviation Details**:
- **Severity**: CRITICAL — BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md Violation (Code-First ≠ Test-First)
- **Root Cause**: Wave 5.5 was added to Implementation Plan without updating Test Registry with frontend-specific tests
- **Impact**: Code-first approach risks untested implementation, breaking the "test-first guarantee enables non-destructive build" principle
- **Remediation**: PR #239 stopped, Issue #240 created QA-to-Red requirement, PR #241 delivered suite

### 2. Implementation Plan Update

**Location**: `modules/mat/03-implementation-plan/implementation-plan.md`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated version from v1.3.0 to **v1.4.0**
- Added **MANDATORY PRE-BUILD GATE** section to Wave 5.5 (§2.6.5)
- Added change note documenting v1.4.0 update (governance remediation after Deviation #10)
- Updated Change Log with v1.4.0 entry

**MANDATORY PRE-BUILD GATE Requirements** (Added to Wave 5.5):

BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION in Wave 5.5 begins:
1. **QA-to-Red Functional Test Suite MUST exist** — Test suite covering all Wave 5.5 features (FR-070, FR-071) generated, committed, approved
2. **Test suite MUST be runnable** — All new tests start RED (expected failures), executable via project test runner
3. **Non-destructive guarantee MUST be validated** — All existing tests (MAT-T-0001 to MAT-T-0098) remain GREEN
4. **Evidence MUST be documented** — PREHANDOVER proof showing: (a) new test suite committed, (b) new tests RED, (c) existing tests GREEN

**Enforcement**: Foreman MUST NOT authorize builder recruitment or issue creation for Wave 5.5 implementation until QA-to-Red suite is complete and committed.

**Critical Principle**: **CODE-FIRST IS NEVER PERMITTED. TEST-FIRST GUARANTEE ENABLES NON-DESTRUCTIVE BUILD.**

### 3. Session Memory Creation

**Location**: `.agent-workspace/foreman-isms/memory/session-011-20260216-wave5.5-qa-to-red-omission-learning.md` (this file)

**Purpose**: Permanent institutional memory of the code-first violation incident and governance learning.

## Governance Alignment

### Canonical Authorities

This session aligns with:
- **BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md**: Architecture → QA-to-Red → Build-to-Green → Validation (canonical workflow)
- **FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md** §3.1, §5.1: Pre-wave authorization gates, fully functional design validation
- **FOREMAN_AUTHORITY_AND_SUPERVISION_MODEL.md**: Foreman orchestration and gate enforcement responsibilities
- **LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md** v6.2.0: Session memory protocol requirements

## Critical Learning: Code-First vs. Test-First

### The Defining Difference

**"Normal Coder" Delivery**:
- Write code first, tests later (or never)
- "It works on my machine"
- Test failures are debugging sessions
- Rework and regression are accepted costs

**Mature Governance Delivery (Maturion)**:
- Test suite PRECEDES implementation (Architecture → QA-to-Red → Build-to-Green)
- All tests start RED (expected failures before implementation)
- Implementation turns tests GREEN (non-destructive, verifiable progress)
- Test-first guarantee enables one-time build correctness
- Rework is governance failure, not expected cost

### Why Test-First is Non-Negotiable

1. **Non-Destructive Guarantee**: Existing tests remain GREEN when new tests added — proves no regression
2. **Verifiable Progress**: Tests turn from RED to GREEN as implementation proceeds — objective evidence of completion
3. **One-Time Build Correctness**: Test suite defines acceptance criteria BEFORE code exists — prevents scope drift
4. **Audit Trail**: Every test has a RED→GREEN transition point with evidence — full traceability
5. **Constitutional Requirement**: BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md mandates Architecture → QA-to-Red → Build-to-Green — not optional

### This Incident Reinforces

**Code-first is NEVER permitted — even for:**
- Remediation waves (like Wave 5.5)
- Small changes
- "Quick fixes"
- Urgent deadlines
- "We know what we're doing"

**No exceptions. No compromises. Test-first or STOP WORK.**

---

## Preventive Measures (Institutionalized)

### Implementation Plan Template Updates

All future waves MUST include:
1. Explicit MANDATORY PRE-BUILD GATE section requiring QA-to-Red suite presence
2. Evidence requirements (test suite committed, tests RED, existing tests GREEN)
3. Foreman authorization gate (no builder recruitment without QA-to-Red suite)

### Foreman Orchestration Protocol Updates

Foreman MUST enforce:
1. **No QA-to-Red suite = No build authorization** — HARD STOP
2. Wave gates MUST include explicit QA-to-Red verification step
3. When new waves added (remediation or otherwise), Test Registry MUST be updated BEFORE builder recruitment
4. PREHANDOVER proof MUST document: (a) QA-to-Red suite committed, (b) tests RED, (c) existing tests GREEN

### Builder Recruitment Protocol Updates

Before recruiting any builder for implementation:
1. Verify QA-to-Red suite exists for wave scope
2. Verify tests are runnable and RED
3. Verify non-destructive guarantee (existing tests GREEN)
4. Document verification in recruitment evidence

## Lessons Learned Summary

### Core Lesson

**CODE-FIRST VIOLATION STOPS WORK — TEST-FIRST GUARANTEE ENABLES NON-DESTRUCTIVE BUILD**

This is the defining difference between mature and "normal coder" delivery.

### Supporting Lessons

1. **Governance doesn't pause for remediation** — New waves follow the same canonical workflow as original waves
2. **Test-first discipline = Non-destructive build guarantee** — This is the core value proposition
3. **MANDATORY PRE-BUILD GATE is now standard** — All future waves include explicit gate language
4. **Foreman enforcement is constitutional** — "No QA-to-Red suite = No build authorization" is now HARD STOP
