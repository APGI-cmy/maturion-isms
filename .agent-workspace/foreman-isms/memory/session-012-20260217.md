# Session Memory — Session 012

**Date**: 2026-02-17  
**Session Type**: POLC Violation Remediation  
**Agent**: Foreman (FM)  
**Repository**: maturion-isms  
**Branch**: copilot/build-mat-frontend  
**Trigger**: CS2 (Johan) review of PR #263 identifying constitutional POLC boundary violation

---

## 1. Session Context

### What Happened
CS2 reviewed PR #263 (MAT Frontend Implementation) and identified that Foreman authored ALL 63 files in the PR, including 52 production source files (.tsx/.ts) in `apps/mat-frontend/src/`. This constitutes a **fourth POLC boundary violation** (prior: PR #128, PR #183, PR #190).

### Why This Is a Violation
Per agent contract Section 1.2 (POLC-Only Constraint):
- ❌ FM MUST NEVER write production code (apps/**/src/**/*.tsx)
- ❌ FM MUST NEVER implement features directly
- ❌ FM MUST NEVER fix builder code directly
- ✅ FM MAY ONLY supervise, plan, organize, lead, control (POLC)

### Violation Details
- **Files Authored**: 63 total (52 .tsx/.ts source files, 11 config/build files)
- **Lines of Code**: ~1704 lines of production React/TypeScript code
- **Components**: App.tsx, 39 component files, 9 page files, i18n, supabase client, service worker
- **Config Files**: vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, tsconfig.node.json, tailwind.config.ts, postcss.config.js, index.html, .env.example, manifest.json

### How the Violation Occurred
1. FM received Issue #262 (MAT Frontend Implementation)
2. FM delegated to ui-builder **sub-agent** (within same session/PR context)
3. ui-builder sub-agent created all files
4. FM committed sub-agent's output as Foreman-authored code
5. Result: All commits authored by Foreman, violating POLC boundary

### Root Cause
- Sub-agent delegation within the same session results in Foreman being the commit author
- This is NOT valid delegation — valid delegation requires builder to be a separate commit author
- The back-and-forth supervision loop (Preflight Section) was skipped
- FM accepted builder output without independent review cycle

---

## 2. POLC Activities (This Session)

### Planning
- Reviewed CS2's corrective action requirements
- Identified all 63 Foreman-authored files requiring removal
- Planned corrective actions within authorized scope

### Organizing
- Prioritized corrective actions: (1) Remove code, (2) Document learning, (3) Create session memory
- Identified delegation path: ui-builder must implement in separate PR with builder as commit author

### Leading
- N/A — No builder to lead in this corrective session (this is a self-remediation session)

### Controlling
- Verified all 52 production source files removed
- Verified all 11 config/build files removed  
- Verified package.json restored to pre-violation state
- Verified .gitignore reverted to pre-violation state
- Verified only QA-to-Red test files remain (not production code)

---

## 3. Builder Delegation Evidence

### This Session
- **NO builder delegation occurred** — This session is corrective (removing Foreman-authored code)
- **Builder delegation is REQUIRED** for reimplementation — ui-builder must create a separate PR

### Required Next Steps (Delegation)
- **Task**: MAT Frontend Implementation (71 QA-to-Red tests to turn GREEN)
- **Assignee**: ui-builder agent (NOT Foreman)
- **Requirement**: Builder must be the commit author in a separate PR
- **Foreman Role**: SUPERVISE ONLY — review, feedback, back-and-forth loop
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 71/71 frontend tests GREEN, fully functional app, README and traceability

---

## 4. Implementation Prohibition Evidence

- ✅ FM did NOT write any new production code in this session
- ✅ FM REMOVED all previously-authored production code (52 .tsx/.ts files)
- ✅ FM REMOVED all previously-authored config files (11 files)
- ✅ FM RESTORED package.json to pre-violation state
- ✅ FM ONLY modified authorized files:
  - `.agent-workspace/foreman-isms/personal/lessons-learned.md` (governance artifact)
  - `.agent-workspace/foreman-isms/personal/patterns.md` (governance artifact)
  - `.agent-workspace/foreman-isms/memory/session-012-20260217.md` (session memory)
  - `.gitignore` (reverted Foreman's unauthorized change)
  - `apps/mat-frontend/package.json` (reverted to pre-violation state)

## 5. Corrective Actions Taken

| # | Action | Status | Evidence |
|---|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Acknowledge POLC violation | ✅ DONE | This session memory, lessons-learned.md |
| 2 | Remove all Foreman-authored production code | ✅ DONE | 52 .tsx/.ts files deleted from apps/mat-frontend/src/ |
| 3 | Remove all Foreman-authored config files | ✅ DONE | 11 config/build files deleted |
| 4 | Restore package.json to pre-violation state | ✅ DONE | Reverted to QA-to-Red baseline |
| 5 | Revert .gitignore to pre-violation state | ✅ DONE | Removed package-lock.json entry |
| 6 | Document learning in lessons-learned.md | ✅ DONE | Session 20260217 entry added |
| 7 | Update patterns.md (POLC-001) | ✅ DONE | Updated to 4 occurrences, escalation threshold |
| 8 | Create session memory | ✅ DONE | This file |
| 9 | Delegate to ui-builder | 🔲 PENDING | Requires separate PR with builder as commit author |

## 6. RCA Summary

### Incident
Fourth POLC boundary violation. Foreman authored 52 production source files in PR #263.

### Root Cause Chain
1. Issue #262 assigned MAT frontend implementation
2. FM correctly identified need for ui-builder delegation
3. FM delegated to ui-builder sub-agent WITHIN same session context
4. Sub-agent output was committed under Foreman's identity
5. Result: Foreman = commit author of production code = POLC violation

### Key Insight
**Sub-agent delegation within the same session/PR is NOT valid POLC delegation.**
Valid delegation requires:
- Builder agent operates in a SEPARATE PR
- Builder agent is the COMMIT AUTHOR
- Foreman reviews via back-and-forth supervision loop
- Foreman NEVER commits production code, even if a sub-agent wrote it

### Prevention
- Documentation-only prevention has failed 3 prior times (PR #128, #183, #190)
- Automated POLC boundary gate (Issue #193) remains the only viable prevention
- Until gate exists: Foreman must treat ANY code authorship as HARD STOP

---

## 7. Governance Alignment

- **POLC-Only Constraint**: Section 1.2 — VIOLATED in prior session, REMEDIATED in this session
- **Session Memory Protocol**: Section 3.2 — This file satisfies requirement
- **Learning Promotion**: Section 3.4 — lessons-learned.md updated
- **Failure Promotion**: Section 3.4 — patterns.md POLC-001 updated, RCA documented
- **Supervision Loop**: Preflight — NOT executed in prior session (violation), documented as learning

---

## 8. Next Session Requirements

1. **ui-builder must implement** MAT frontend in a separate PR where builder is commit author
2. **Foreman must SUPERVISE ONLY** — review builder's PR, provide feedback, back-and-forth loop
3. **Foreman must NOT commit** any production code, even "small fixes"
4. **Session memory must document** POLC activities (Planning, Organizing, Leading, Controlling) — NOT implementation
5. **Wake-up protocol** must load this session memory and verify POLC-001 pattern awareness

---

**Session End**: 2026-02-17  
**POLC Compliance**: ✅ This session contains ONLY authorized governance activities  
**Production Code Authored**: ZERO (this session removed prior violations)
