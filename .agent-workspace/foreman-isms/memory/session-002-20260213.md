     - 7 primary entities with complete properties and relationships
     - Data constraints (immutability, cardinality, validation)
   - Added Section 3.3: Non-Functional Requirements (98 lines)
     - Performance requirements (response time, throughput, scalability)
     - Security requirements (auth, encryption, privacy)
     - Compliance requirements (audit trail, integrity, regulatory)
     - Availability & reliability (uptime, backup, offline)
     - Usability requirements (mobile, accessibility, i18n)
   - Enhanced Section 4: Roles & Permissions (51 lines)
     - Added authority levels per role
     - Added assignment flow (mandatory/optional)
     - Added approval authority hierarchy
   - Enhanced Section 15.4: AI Routing and Extension Governance (36 lines)
     - AI task classification (Tier-1, Tier-2, Tier-3)
     - Model governance protocols
     - Extension points for future capabilities
   - Enhanced Section 16: QA and Acceptance Criteria (111 lines)

     - 16.3: AI Governance Acceptance Criteria (4 criteria: AC-AI01 to AC-AI04)
     - All criteria have Given/When/Then format with measurable targets
   - Enhanced Section 17: Watchdog and Continuous Improvement (added detailed monitoring and feedback loop)

3. **Build Progress Tracker Creation Phase**
   - Created BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md (590 lines)
   - Structure:
     - Overall Progress Summary table (8 phases)
     - Phase 00: App Description (4 sub-tasks, 20% complete, 3 deviations documented)
     - Phase 01: FRS (4 sub-tasks planned)
     - Phase 02: Architecture (7 sub-tasks planned)
     - Phase 03: Implementation Plan (4 sub-tasks planned)
     - Phase 04: Builder Appointment (3 sub-tasks planned)
     - Phase 05: Build Execution (6 waves, 51 total checklist items)
     - Phase 06: Evidence & QA (4 sub-tasks planned)
     - Phase 07: Handover (4 sub-tasks planned)
   - Each phase includes:
     - Objective statement
     - Planned/actual dates and duration
     - Detailed checklist with checkboxes
     - Planned % vs Actual % completion
     - Deviations from Plan section
     - Lessons Learned section
   - Added "Improvement Points & Deferrals" section
   - Added "Learning Loop Integration" section with governance authority citations

### Decisions Made

1. **Decision: Use XDETECT as template for governance header**
   - **Why**: XDETECT represents the gold-standard governance-compliant App Description in the repository
   - **Canonical Authority**: APP_DESCRIPTION_REQUIREMENT_POLICY.md
   - **Impact**: Ensures consistency across modules, prevents FRS generation blockers

2. **Decision: Add explicit data model (Section 3.2) rather than leaving it implied**
   - **Why**: One-Time Build Correctness requires frozen data model before architecture phase
   - **Canonical Authority**: BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md (Architecture → QA-to-Red → Build-to-Green)
   - **Impact**: Prevents schema inconsistencies during Wave 0 (database setup)

3. **Decision: Convert bullet-point QA criteria to measurable Given/When/Then format**
   - **Why**: Build-to-Green requires testable, falsifiable acceptance criteria
   - **Canonical Authority**: BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md, EXECUTION_BOOTSTRAP_PROTOCOL.md
   - **Impact**: Enables PREHANDOVER proof generation and QA automation

4. **Decision: Document deviations in BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER even though we're still in Phase 00**
   - **Why**: Deviations from original App Description scope are already occurring; must capture for learning
   - **Canonical Authority**: FAILURE_PROMOTION_RULE.md, LEARNING_PROMOTION_RULE.md
   - **Impact**: Prevents second-time failures, feeds governance learning loop

5. **Decision: Create tracker with all 8 phases upfront (even though only Phase 00 is active)**
   - **Why**: Enables proactive planning, ensures no phase is forgotten, provides handover clarity from day 1
   - **Canonical Authority**: FOREMAN_WAVE_PLANNING_AND_ISSUE_ARTIFACT_GENERATION_PROTOCOL.md
   - **Impact**: Full visibility into build journey, supports CS2/Maturion handover requirements

## Evidence

### Execution Evidence
- Status: Documentation changes only (no executable artifacts this session)
- PREHANDOVER proof: Not applicable (documentation enhancement, not code)
- CI results: Not applicable (no code changes)
- Files changed: 2 (1 modified, 1 created)
- Lines added: +1063 (app-description +525, tracker +590, removed -52 from app-description reformatting)

### Ripple Status
- Ripple detected: **NO**
- Ripple surfaces: None (local to MAT module, no cross-module dependencies)
- Ripple escalated: N/A
- Justification: 
  - App Description changes are scoped to MAT module only
  - BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER is MAT-specific artifact
  - No governance canon changes made
  - No cross-repo impacts

### Governance Alignment
- Canon hashes verified: **YES** (no canon changes required or made)
- Drift detected: **NO**
- Alignment status: **ALIGNED**
- Evidence:
  - Used XDETECT as reference model (already governance-compliant)
  - Referenced APP_DESCRIPTION_REQUIREMENT_POLICY.md
  - Aligned to BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md principles
  - Integrated LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0 requirements
  - Followed FOREMAN_MEMORY_PROTOCOL.md for session memory creation

## Outcome

✅ **COMPLETE**

All issue requirements satisfied:

**App Description Fixes (6/6 complete):**
1. ✅ Governance metadata header added
2. ✅ Non-functional requirements added (5 subsections, 98 lines)
3. ✅ Measurable acceptance criteria added (15 criteria with targets)
4. ✅ Roles & permissions matrix enhanced (authority, approval flows)
5. ✅ Core data model added (7 entities, complete ERD)
6. ✅ AI routing and extension governance enhanced

**Build Progress Tracker (8/8 complete):**
1. ✅ Created BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
2. ✅ All build phases covered (8 phases: App Description → Handover)
3. ✅ Checklist structure with sub-tasks (51 total items)
4. ✅ % completion tracking (phase-level and overall)
5. ✅ Deviation/lessons tracking per phase
6. ✅ Overall progress calculation (3% based on 1/8 phases in progress)
7. ✅ Improvement points logging section

2. After CS2 approval, mark as "Authoritative" (Phase 00.4)
3. FRS generation can begin (Phase 01)

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Using XDETECT app-description.md as reference model saved significant exploration time
- Modular section structure made incremental enhancements straightforward
- Early governance compliance prevents downstream rework
- Parallel analysis of governance requirements while reviewing current state was efficient
- Creating comprehensive tracker upfront provides clear roadmap for entire build

### What Was Challenging
- Balancing comprehensiveness with readability (860 lines is long for an App Description)
- Determining appropriate level of detail for acceptance criteria (too specific = over-constraining, too vague = not measurable)
- Defining appropriate scope for NFRs without duplicating FRS/Architecture content
- Estimating % completion for Phase 00 (settled on 20% as governance complete but peer review pending)

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- **Template Discovery**: XDETECT should be the standard template for all future App Descriptions
- **NFRs are Mandatory**: All App Descriptions must include Section 3.3 NFRs before FRS generation
- **Data Model First**: Explicit data model (Section 3.2) is foundational; must be in App Description
- **Measurable AC**: Acceptance criteria must use Given/When/Then with measurable targets (%, counts, thresholds)
- **Tracker Value**: BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER provides immense value for handover; recommend for all modules
- **Deviation Capture**: Document deviations immediately when they occur, not retrospectively
- **Learning Loop**: Each phase's lessons feed governance memory; this is not optional

### Recommendations for Governance Canon
1. **Recommendation**: Create APP_DESCRIPTION_TEMPLATE.md in governance/templates/ based on XDETECT
   - **Why**: Standardize App Description structure across all modules
   - **Authority**: APP_DESCRIPTION_REQUIREMENT_POLICY.md
   - **Impact**: Reduce variance, accelerate App Description creation

2. **Recommendation**: Mandate BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md for all modules
   - **Why**: Provides critical handover clarity, supports one-time build correctness
   - **Authority**: MANDATORY_CANONICAL_PROGRESS_RECORDING_AND_WAVE_CLOSURE_CERTIFICATION.md
   - **Impact**: CS2/Maturion handover quality significantly improved

3. **Recommendation**: Add NFR checklist to APP_DESCRIPTION_REQUIREMENT_POLICY.md
   - **Why**: NFRs currently implied but not explicitly required; this caused original MAT gap
   - **Authority**: APP_DESCRIPTION_REQUIREMENT_POLICY.md (amendment)
   - **Impact**: Ensures all App Descriptions include performance, security, compliance from day 1
