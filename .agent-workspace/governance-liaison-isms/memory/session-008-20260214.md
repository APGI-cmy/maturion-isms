# Session 008 - 20260214 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-liaison-isms
- Class: liaison
- Session ID: session-008
- Date: 2026-02-14T09:33:17Z

## Task
**Issue #115**: [Learning Loop] Living Agent System Installation: Audit Trail, Prior Violation Reference, and Protocol Success (PR #118)

**Objective**: Complete the learning loop documentation for the successful Living Agent System v6.2.0 installation in PR #118, explicitly referencing the authority violations in closed PR #116.

**Context**: 
- PR #116 was closed due to authority violations (governance-liaison directly edited agent contracts, test dodging language)
- PR #118 (rerun) succeeded by respecting authority boundaries (invoked Codex for contract changes, transparent error reporting)
- This session documents the learning loop closure with comprehensive audit trail

### Actions Taken
1. ✅ **Wake-Up Protocol Executed** (REQ-AS-005)
   - Command: `.github/scripts/wake-up-protocol.sh governance-liaison-isms`
   - Result: All 7 phases PASSED
   - CANON_INVENTORY: Valid (102 artifacts, version 1.0.0)
   - No governance drift detected
   - Previous sessions loaded: 8 (most recent: session-007)

2. ✅ **Reviewed Session 007 Memory**
   - Examined PR #118 implementation details
   - Confirmed: 10 errors detected → Codex invoked → 0 errors remaining
   - Authority chain: governance-liaison → task tool → CodexAdvisor-agent

3. ✅ **Verified Current State**
   - Command: `.github/scripts/agent-file-validator.sh`
   - Result: 4 files validated, all VALID, 0 errors
   - Living Agent System v6.2.0 compliance: VERIFIED

4. ✅ **Examined Evidence Files**
   - Reviewed: `AGENT_CONTRACT_YAML_FIXES_EVIDENCE.md`
   - Confirmed: Comprehensive before/after documentation (10 errors → 0 errors)
   - Authority compliance: CodexAdvisor authority exercised properly

5. ✅ **Checked GitHub Actions Workflow Status**
   - Most recent workflow: "Merge Gate Interface" 
   - Status: completed with "action_required" conclusion
   - Note: This is expected for WIP PRs awaiting review

6. ✅ **Updated Personal Learning Artifacts**
   - Added 8 lessons to `personal/lessons-learned.md`:
     * Transparent error reporting is mandatory
     * Never modify agent contracts outside proper authority
     * Bootstrap paradox solution (embedded checklist)
     * Learning loop requires explicit reference to prior violations
     * Scripts and automation must enforce governance
     * Codex invocation pattern for contract changes
     * Evidence bundle proves compliance
     * PR descriptions must include authority references
   
   - Added 6 patterns to `personal/patterns.md`:
     * Authority boundary enforcement via tool restrictions
     * Learning loop activation through transparent failure documentation
     * Embedded authority checklist solves bootstrap paradox
     * Before/after transparent error counting
     * Evidence-first execution for protected changes
     * Automated validation enforces governance boundaries

7. ✅ **Created Session Memory** (this document)
   - Complete audit trail of learning loop documentation
   - References to PR #116 violations and PR #118 compliance

### Decisions Made

1. **Learning Documentation Scope Decision**
   - **What**: Document learning loop in personal learning artifacts (lessons-learned.md, patterns.md) rather than creating new top-level document
   - **Why**: Personal learning artifacts are the canonical location for agent learning per LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0
   - **Authority**: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0 Session Closure Protocol (REQ-EO-005)

2. **Prior Violation Reference Decision**
   - **What**: Explicitly reference PR #116 violations in lessons learned
   - **Why**: Learning loop requires transparent acknowledgment of prior failures to prevent recurrence
   - **Authority**: Issue #115 description requirement for "explicit reference to the previous protocol and authority violations"

3. **Evidence Bundle Preservation Decision**
   - **What**: Do not modify or regenerate AGENT_CONTRACT_YAML_FIXES_EVIDENCE.md
   - **Why**: Evidence artifacts are immutable (REQ-ER-001); existing evidence from Session 007 is authoritative
   - **Authority**: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0 (REQ-ER-001 - Evidence artifacts immutable)

## Lessons

### What Worked Well

1. **Wake-Up Protocol Automation**
   - Running `.github/scripts/wake-up-protocol.sh` at session start provided comprehensive environment health check
   - 7-phase validation caught potential issues early (drift detection, memory scan, governance state)

2. **Session Memory Review**
   - Loading and reviewing Session 007 memory provided complete context for learning loop documentation
   - Session 007's transparent reporting ("10 errors → 0 errors") served as excellent template

3. **Personal Learning Artifacts Organization**
   - Separate files for lessons-learned.md (specific incidents) and patterns.md (recurring patterns) creates clear organization
   - Session-by-session structure enables temporal tracking of learning

4. **Evidence File Quality**
   - AGENT_CONTRACT_YAML_FIXES_EVIDENCE.md from Session 007 provided comprehensive audit trail
   - Before/after validation tables made success measurable and verifiable

### What Was Challenging

1. **Understanding Learning Loop Scope**
   - Initially unclear whether to create new top-level learning loop document or use personal artifacts
   - Resolved by recognizing personal learning artifacts as canonical location per Living Agent System

2. **Distinguishing Between Sessions 007 and 008**
   - Session 007: Implemented the fix (scripts, Codex invocation, validation)
   - Session 008: Documented the learning loop closure (lessons, patterns, audit trail)
   - Both are part of the same learning cycle but have different objectives

3. **Avoiding Redundancy**
   - Session 007 already documented many lessons; Session 008 needed to synthesize and generalize
   - Solution: Focus on cross-session patterns and learning loop closure aspects

### What Future Sessions Should Know

1. **Learning Loop Documentation Pattern**
   - After protocol-compliant success following violations, document in personal learning artifacts
   - Reference prior violations explicitly (e.g., "PR #116 violations → PR #118 compliance")
   - Capture both specific lessons (lessons-learned.md) and recurring patterns (patterns.md)

2. **Session Memory Completeness**
   - Session memory should document: task, actions, decisions (with rationale), evidence, alignment state, outcome, lessons
   - "What and why" documentation enables future agents to understand decision context

3. **Authority Boundary Vigilance**
   - Always check file ownership before editing (agent contracts require Codex)
   - Use task tool to invoke appropriate authority agent when needed
   - Document authority chain in evidence and session memory

4. **Transparent Error Reporting**
   - State exact counts: "X errors found → Y fixed → Z remaining"
   - Never minimize or use vague language ("some issues", "minor problems")
   - Before/after validation results provide measurable evidence

5. **Evidence Bundle Immutability**
   - Once evidence file is created (e.g., AGENT_CONTRACT_YAML_FIXES_EVIDENCE.md), do not modify
   - Create new evidence file for re-validation or additional changes
   - REQ-ER-001: Evidence artifacts are immutable

### Governance Insights

1. **Learning Loop Activates Through Transparent Failure Documentation**
   - PR #116 closure with explicit violation documentation enabled successful PR #118
   - Transparent reporting of failures is prerequisite for learning
   - Authority: Issue #115 demonstrates learning loop activation pattern

2. **Personal Learning Artifacts Are Critical Infrastructure**
   - lessons-learned.md and patterns.md accumulate institutional knowledge across sessions
   - Future agents benefit from prior sessions' documented learning
   - Authority: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0 (REQ-EO-005 - personal learning updates)

3. **Authority Boundaries Prevent Self-Modification Paradox**
   - Agents cannot modify their own contracts (would enable authority escalation)
   - Codex authority provides checks and balances
   - Authority: AGENT_CONTRACT_PROTECTION_PROTOCOL.md

4. **Bootstrap Paradox Solution Generalizes**
   - Embedded authority checklist in issue description solved "how to comply before infrastructure exists"
   - Pattern applies to any system installation or bootstrap scenario
   - Authority: Session 007 success; generalizable to other installations

5. **Automated Validation Scales Governance Enforcement**
   - Manual checks don't scale; validators (agent-file-validator.sh) enforce boundaries automatically
   - Scripts provide deterministic, repeatable governance checks
   - Authority: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0 automated validation requirements
