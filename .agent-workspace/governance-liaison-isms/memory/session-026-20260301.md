## Task
Complete the liaison checklist for the Layer-Down issue "[Layer-Down] Governance ripple received — 6644ee51ce71". Canonical commit `6644ee51ce714d3a9331b28b74b3e05f1b7ee880`. PR #686 was merged by CS2 on 2026-02-28T14:18:09Z, updating 4 files. Session-025 had incorrectly classified this as a "no_change_ripple" because it ran while PR #686 was still in DRAFT state (session-025 at 14:14:40Z, PR merged at 14:18:09Z). This session corrects the record and completes all outstanding liaison checklist items.

## What I Did

### Analysis

**B-04 check**: The canonical commit `6644ee51` was processed by automated alignment (align-20260228-141328) which correctly recorded 4 files_updated. Session-025 was incorrect in classifying it as no_change. The automated alignment WAS the layer-down; session-026 now confirms and records it properly.

**Files layered down in PR #686** (verified against CANON_INVENTORY.json):
1. `governance/canon/REQUIREMENT_SPECIFICATION_GOVERNANCE.md` — updated hash: `645cf74498ff42d8aebdd7eeb7c2d60ccf23ef099c8dd8877ff202a930a98063` ✅
2. `governance/canon/VERSIONING_AND_EVOLUTION_GOVERNANCE.md` — updated hash: `590509c92e0a945dee8dafa6fb6614f4300bc08c9f38a84ce1df5bcf4d8bcf32` ✅
3. `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` — updated with new hashes ✅
4. `governance/sync_state.json` — updated sync state ✅

### Liaison Checklist

#### 1. Verify files layered down match canonical inventory ✅
- PR #686 updated 2 canon files + CANON_INVENTORY.json + sync_state.json (4 files total)
- Both canon files had hash mismatches detected by drift report `drift-report-align-20260228-141328.md`
- CANON_INVENTORY.json updated with new SHA256 hashes for both files
- All file updates SHA256-verified per drift report

#### 2. Confirm AIMC canon is integrated and referenced where relevant ✅
- `REQUIREMENT_SPECIFICATION_GOVERNANCE.md`: Foundational governance doc for requirement specifications. AIMC artifacts (GRS, APS) already conform to requirement specification governance standards. No new direct cross-references needed — AIMC documents derive authority from AIMC_STRATEGY.md and LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md; requirement specification governance applies through the authority chain.
- `VERSIONING_AND_EVOLUTION_GOVERNANCE.md`: Foundational governance doc for versioning. AIMC documents already use semantic versioning and follow versioning governance standards. No new direct cross-references needed.
- AIMC integration: CONFIRMED

#### 3. Trigger internal ripple: update cross-references and linked artefacts ✅
- GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md updated: Latest Ripple PR #686, Latest Canonical Commit, Layer-Down Session, total canons count (111→113), Last Sync, Note
- governance/sync_state.json updated: session-026 liaison confirmation
- .agent-admin/governance/ripple-log.json: Fixed malformed JSON + added session-026 liaison-confirmation entry

#### 4. Document completion in session memory and evidence artefacts ✅
- Session memory: this file (session-026-20260301.md)
- Ripple-log.json: session-026 liaison-confirmation entry added
- Escalation archived: agent-contract-ripple-escalation-2026-02-28.md moved to escalation-archive/

### Files Modified

| File | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `.agent-admin/governance/ripple-log.json` | FIXED + UPDATED | Fixed malformed JSON (missing closing brace after session-025 entry); added session-026 liaison-confirmation entry |
| `governance/sync_state.json` | UPDATED | Updated to session-026 liaison confirmation (timestamp, session_id, total_canons_synced=4, sync_method, ripple_pr, files_layered_down) |
| `GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md` | UPDATED | Updated header (Last Updated, Layer-Down Session, Latest Ripple PR, Latest Canonical Commit), Summary (total canons 111→113, Last Sync, Note) |
| `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison/escalation-inbox/agent-contract-ripple-escalation-2026-02-28.md` | ARCHIVED | Moved to escalation-archive/ with RESOLVED status; PR #686 merged by CS2 |
| `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison/escalation-archive/agent-contract-ripple-escalation-2026-02-28.md` | CREATED | Archive copy with resolution details |
| `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/memory/session-021-20260226.md` | ARCHIVED | Memory rotation: archived to .archive/ to maintain 5-session window |
| `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/memory/session-026-20260301.md` | CREATED | This file |
| `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md` | UPDATED | Added session-026 suggestions |

### Actions Taken
- Executed Phase 1 preflight (all 7 steps)
- Reviewed last 5 sessions: identified unresolved items (malformed JSON, incorrect no_change classification in session-025, incomplete liaison checklist)
- Verified 4 files layered down in PR #686 against CANON_INVENTORY.json hashes
- Confirmed AIMC integration (both updated files are foundational governance docs; AIMC artifacts already conform)
- Fixed malformed ripple-log.json (missing `},` and `{` between session-025 and align entries)
- Added session-026 liaison-confirmation entry to ripple-log.json
- Updated sync_state.json with session-026 liaison confirmation
- Updated GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md (header, summary, note)
- Archived resolved escalation (PR #686 merged by CS2)
- Archived session-021 to memory/.archive/ (memory rotation)
- Created this session memory (session-026)
- Updated parking-station suggestions log

### Decisions Made
- B-04 did NOT prevent this session: session-025's "no_change" classification was incorrect (it ran before PR #686 was merged); this session completes the outstanding liaison checklist items rather than re-executing the layer-down
- AIMC integration: no new cross-references needed in AIMC documents; the updated governance docs apply through the existing authority chain
- Escalation archival: agent-contract-ripple-escalation-2026-02-28.md archived as RESOLVED since PR #686 was merged by CS2

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE — All liaison checklist items completed, ripple-log.json repaired, records updated.

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Session-025 and the automated CI correctly recorded the drift detection and file updates — the timeline issue (session-025 running before PR #686 merged) was predictable given the concurrent execution model
- CANON_INVENTORY.json hash validation via drift-report gave clear evidence of which files were updated

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- When a liaison session runs while a CS2-gated DRAFT PR is pending, the session may classify the ripple as "no_change" even if files ARE being updated. A subsequent session should check the PR merge status and correct the record.
- The ripple-log.json malformation (missing closing brace) occurred because session-025's entry was created without a closing comma, then the next entry was appended directly. The automated CI append script should add proper JSON object separation.
- The GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md "Latest Ripple PR" field should be updated to reflect the most recently merged ripple PR, not the last one that auto-merged without CS2 involvement.

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY — this field may NEVER be blank)

1. **ripple-log.json append safety**: The automated CI script that appends entries to ripple-log.json should validate JSON structure before and after appending (using `jq` or `python3 -c "import json; json.load(...)"`). This would have caught the malformed JSON from session-025 immediately.

2. **Session-PR timing race condition**: When a liaison session runs while a CS2-gated DRAFT PR is pending, there's a race condition between the session completing and the PR being merged. The session memory template should include a "pending_cs2_prs" field to flag any draft PRs that should be verified in the next session.

3. **Liaison checklist partial completion tracking**: The liaison issue checklist had items that couldn't be completed in session-025 (because PR #686 was still draft). A standard "PARTIAL_COMPLETION — follow-up in session NNN" note in the ripple-log entry would signal to the next session that the checklist needs completion.
