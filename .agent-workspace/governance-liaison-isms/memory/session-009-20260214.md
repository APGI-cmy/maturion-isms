## Task
**Issue**: [Governance] Create Builder Agent File Checklist Artifact, Ripple Tier-0 References to Canon Inventory, and Update Build Tracker

**Objective**: Create comprehensive builder agent file compliance checklist artifact (version 1.1.0), remove all legacy "Tier-0" terminology and replace with Canon Inventory alignment logic, update BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER with Stage 3.5, and provide complete ripple evidence.

**Context**: 
- Legacy "Tier-0" terminology caused confusion between theoretical hierarchy and actual implementation (CANON_INVENTORY.json)
- Builder agent file checklist creation step was historically omitted from module lifecycle
- Foreman needs machine-checkable validation criteria for builder recruitment

### Actions Taken

1. ✅ **Wake-Up Protocol Executed** (REQ-AS-005)
   - Command: `.github/scripts/wake-up-protocol.sh governance-liaison-isms`
   - Result: All 7 phases PASSED
   - CANON_INVENTORY: Valid (102 artifacts, version 1.0.0)
   - No governance drift detected
   - Previous sessions loaded: 8 (most recent: session-008)

2. ✅ **Repository Scanned for Tier-0 References**
   - Used grep to identify all files with Tier-0 terminology
   - Found ~20 instances across 3 key governance files
   - Categorized references: structural (replace) vs. classification (keep)

3. ✅ **Created Governance Artifacts Directory**
   - Created: `governance/artifacts/`
   - Purpose: Canonical location for governance artifacts like checklists

4. ✅ **Created Builder Agent File Compliance Checklist**
   - File: `governance/artifacts/BUILDER_AGENT_FILE_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Version: 1.1.0 (first production version, v1.0.0 never released)
   - Breaking change in version history: removed all Tier-0 terminology
   - Comprehensive 8-section machine-checkable checklist

5. ✅ **Updated BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER**
   - Added Stage 3.5 between Implementation Plan and Builder Appointment
   - Documented process upgrade with rationale
   - Updated template version to 1.2.0

6. ✅ **Replaced Tier-0 Structural Terminology**
   - AGENT_FILE_BINDING_REQUIREMENTS.md: 8 replacements
   - Governance liaison checklist: 3 replacements
   - Foreman checklist: similar replacements
   - Pattern: "Tier-0 bindings" → "Universal Mandatory Bindings"

7. ✅ **Created Ripple Evidence Document**
   - File: `TIER_0_TO_CANON_INVENTORY_RIPPLE_EVIDENCE.md`
   - Complete audit trail, terminology mapping, validation commands
   - Authority chain documented (CS2 → Foreman → Governance Liaison)

8. ✅ **Committed Changes via report_progress**
   - Commit 1: Create builder agent file compliance checklist artifact v1.1.0
   - Commit 2: Update BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER to add Stage 3.5
   - Commit 3: Remove Tier-0 terminology and replace with Canon Inventory alignment

9. ⚠️ **Session Closure Script Issue**
   - Attempted: `.github/scripts/session-closure.sh governance-liaison-isms`
   - Issue: Script error with session number parsing (leading zeros)
   - Workaround: Manual session memory creation (this document)

### Decisions Made

1. **Terminology Replacement Strategy**
   - **What**: Replace structural Tier-0 references, preserve classification references
   - **Why**: Technical implementation uses CANON_INVENTORY.json; terminology should match reality
   - **Authority**: PENDING_CANON_REFERENCES_INTERIM_GUIDANCE.md Section 8.3 authorizes replacement

2. **Builder Checklist Version Decision**
   - **What**: Start at v1.1.0, skip v1.0.0
   - **Why**: v1.0.0 would have Tier-0 terminology (legacy); v1.1.0 is first production-ready version
   - **Authority**: Semantic versioning best practices

3. **BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER Stage Number**
   - **What**: Insert as Stage 3.5 (between Stage 3 and Stage 4)
   - **Why**: Maintains existing stage numbers, clearly shows insertion point
   - **Authority**: Similar to how Stage 2.5 (QA-to-Red) was inserted

4. **Self-Alignment Authority Exercise**
   - **What**: Execute ripple under self-alignment authority (no CS2 approval required)
   - **Why**: Terminology synchronization aligns local governance with canonical source
   - **Authority**: REQ-AS-001, GOVERNANCE_LIAISON_MINIMUM_APPOINTMENT_REQUIREMENTS.md Section 4.2

5. **Evidence Document Location**
   - **What**: Place TIER_0_TO_CANON_INVENTORY_RIPPLE_EVIDENCE.md at repository root
   - **Why**: High visibility for Foreman/CS2 review, consistent with other evidence documents
   - **Authority**: Evidence artifact best practices (REQ-ER-001/002)

## Lessons

### What Worked Well

1. **Self-Alignment Authority**
   - Governance Liaison's unique self-alignment authority (REQ-AS-001) enabled efficient terminology synchronization
   - No CS2 approval required for aligning local governance with canonical source
   - Clear authority boundaries prevented overreach

2. **Systematic Ripple Approach**
   - Scan → Categorize → Replace → Verify workflow ensured completeness
   - Distinguishing structural vs. classification references prevented over-correction
   - Evidence-first approach (creating TIER_0_TO_CANON_INVENTORY_RIPPLE_EVIDENCE.md) ensured transparency

3. **report_progress Tool**
   - Frequent commits kept PR manageable
   - Clear commit messages aided review
   - Incremental progress tracking enabled recovery if needed

4. **Explore Agent Usage**
   - Using explore agent to analyze Tier-0 reference patterns saved time
   - Got comprehensive summary of different contexts and replacement strategies
   - Avoided manual file-by-file analysis

### What Was Challenging

1. **Session Closure Script Issue**
   - Script failed with leading zero parsing error (008 interpreted as octal)
   - Workaround: Manual session memory creation
   - Future fix needed: Update script to handle session numbers 001-099

2. **Distinguishing Reference Types**
   - Had to carefully distinguish structural references (replace) from classification references (keep)
   - "Tier-0" used both as file binding term AND authority hierarchy descriptor
   - Solution: Consult PENDING_CANON_REFERENCES_INTERIM_GUIDANCE.md for authoritative guidance

3. **Multiple File Edits**
   - Initial attempts to use edit tool had conflicts with multiple similar strings
   - Solution: Use sed for batch replacements, verify with grep
   - Lesson: For terminology ripples, regex tools more efficient than individual edits

### What Future Sessions Should Know

1. **Terminology Ripple Pattern**
   - When canonical governance updates terminology, follow this pattern:
     1. Execute wake-up protocol
     2. Scan for all instances (grep -r)
     3. Categorize references (structural vs. classification)
     4. Create replacement strategy (consult canonical guidance)
     5. Execute replacements (sed for batch, edit for specific)
     6. Verify completeness (grep again)
     7. Create ripple evidence document
     8. Commit via report_progress

2. **Builder Checklist Usage**
   - BUILDER_AGENT_FILE_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md is now canonical reference for Foreman
   - Version 1.1.0 is first production version (no legacy Tier-0)
   - Foreman MUST use this checklist before appointing any builders
   - Machine-checkable: can be automated with validator script

3. **Stage 3.5 in Module Lifecycle**
   - All future modules MUST include Stage 3.5 (Builder Checklist Creation)
   - Occurs after Implementation Plan, before Builder Appointment
   - BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER template v1.2.0 includes this stage
   - Prevents historical process deviation from recurring

4. **Session Closure Script Issue**
   - If session-closure.sh fails with "value too great for base" error, create session memory manually
   - Follow template in LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0 Section 3.4
   - Report issue for script fix (leading zero handling)

5. **Canon Inventory is Reality**
   - CANON_INVENTORY.json is the actual technical implementation
   - Tier-0 manifest never existed (was placeholder)
   - Always reference Canon Inventory for binding requirements
   - SHA256 validation is mandatory (per CANON_INVENTORY_INTEGRITY_REQUIREMENTS.md)

### Governance Insights

1. **Terminology Consistency Critical**
   - Mixed terminology (Tier-0 vs. Canon Inventory) caused confusion
   - Technical implementation and documentation must align
   - Regular terminology audits recommended to catch drift early

2. **Process Deviations Accumulate**
   - Builder checklist creation was omitted historically
   - QA-to-Red stage was also omitted (corrected in Session 007)
   - Template updates (BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER v1.2.0) prevent recurrence

3. **Self-Alignment Authority Enables Efficiency**
   - Governance Liaison can self-align without blocking on CS2
   - Clear authority boundaries (CANNOT modify contracts, CANNOT interpret policy)
   - Transparent reporting (session memory, ripple evidence) maintains trust

4. **Evidence-First Execution**
   - Creating TIER_0_TO_CANON_INVENTORY_RIPPLE_EVIDENCE.md before completing work ensured nothing was missed
   - Comprehensive audit trail aids future governance archaeology
   - Validation commands enable others to verify compliance

5. **Builder Checklist Fills Critical Gap**
   - Foreman lacked machine-checkable validation criteria for builder recruitment
   - BUILDER_AGENT_FILE_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md v1.1.0 fills this gap
   - Enables consistent, reliable builder constitution
