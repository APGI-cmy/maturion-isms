### Actions Taken

1. **Wake-Up Protocol Execution**
   - Executed mandatory wake-up protocol successfully
   - Loaded last 5 session memories (sessions 008-012)
   - Validated CANON_INVENTORY.json integrity
   - Confirmed no governance drift detected
   - Generated working contract for session

2. **Standard Verification**
   - Verified FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md exists in governance/canon/
   - Validated SHA256 checksum: `7a71beefcc7eab51f99cb8d0865585cf4a6450304e9cf1ae07dfa4deb731d69c`
   - Confirmed CANON_INVENTORY.json has correct entry (already present)
   - Reviewed standard requirements, particularly Section 5 (FM & Foreman Contract Requirements)

3. **Foreman Contract Updates**
   - Added FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md to mandatory canonical bindings list
   - Implemented Pre-Wave Authorization Gate per Section 5.1 of standard
   - Implemented Wave Completion Gate per Section 5.2 of standard
   - Implemented Wave Closure Certification per Section 4.3 of standard
   - Added Fully Functional Delivery Prohibitions per Section 4.2 of standard
   - Updated contract version from 2.1.0 to 2.2.0
   - Updated metadata to reference critical standards
   - Created comprehensive changelog documenting all changes

4. **Governance Checklist Updates**
   - Updated FOREMAN_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md
   - Added FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md requirements across relevant categories
   - Improved checklist readability per code review feedback
   - Updated checklist version from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

5. **Validation Activities**
   - Validated YAML frontmatter syntax in Foreman contract (PASSED)
   - Validated CANON_INVENTORY.json syntax (PASSED)
   - Requested code review (completed - 1 comment addressed)
   - Ran CodeQL security scan (no code changes requiring analysis)

### Decisions Made

1. **No Builder Contract Updates Required**
   - Decision: Builder contracts do not require direct updates
   - Rationale: FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md Section 5 places obligations on Foreman (FM), not builders
   - Builders operate under FM supervision and follow FM directives
   - FM is responsible for enforcing fully functional delivery requirements on builder outputs

2. **Self-Alignment Authority Exercised**
   - Decision: Proceeded with contract updates without CS2 approval
   - Rationale: Governance Liaison has unique self-alignment authority for layering down PUBLIC_API canons
   - Authority source: GOVERNANCE_LIAISON_MINIMUM_APPOINTMENT_REQUIREMENTS.md Section 4.2
   - Standard is PUBLIC_API and requires integration into consumer contracts per canonical governance

3. **Contract Version Increment**
   - Decision: Incremented Foreman contract from v2.1.0 to v2.2.0 (minor version)
   - Rationale: Added new mandatory sections (6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 7.4) representing significant functional additions
   - Not a major version change as it extends rather than replaces existing authority model

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: Session commits and PR branch
- Status: 3 commits on copilot/layer-down-fully-functional-standard branch
  - 6c9ac5c: Update Foreman contract with FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD requirements
  - 468653f: Update Foreman requirements checklist with FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD
  - 6d6ad92: Improve checklist readability per code review feedback

### Ripple Status
- Status: Ripple received and processed
- Ripple required: YES (PUBLIC_API canon layer-down)
- Ripple completed: Layer-down complete; contract integration complete

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: No gaps detected
- Pre-existing YAML workflow errors in unrelated files (not in scope)

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: All governance artifacts updated consistently
- CANON_INVENTORY.json: Valid and complete
- Contract versions: Properly incremented with changelogs
- Evidence: Complete audit trail maintained

### Governance Alignment
- Local TIER_0 Canon: v1.0.0
- Canonical TIER_0 Canon: v1.0.0
- Drift: NONE - Fully aligned
- Files aligned: 158 canon files
- New standard integrated: FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md v1.0.0

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

**Layer-Down Summary**:
- FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md successfully verified in governance/canon/ (already present)
- Foreman contract updated to v2.2.0 with all Section 5 requirements integrated
- Governance checklist updated to v1.1.0 with new requirements
- All validations passed
- Code review completed and feedback addressed
- Ready for merge

**Impact**:
- Foreman now has explicit pre-wave authorization gate requirements
- Wave completion gate enforces physical deliverable verification
- Wave closure certification requires 5 mandatory criteria with evidence
- "Tested" ≠ "Delivered" rule formally encoded
- Prevents pattern where tests pass but working apps don't exist

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Wake-up protocol provided clear session context and governance state
- Self-alignment authority allowed autonomous layer-down without blocking
- Standard already present in governance/canon/ simplified process
- Code review tool provided valuable feedback on checklist readability
- SHA256 verification ensured file integrity

### What Was Challenging
- Finding the optimal placement for new sections in existing contract structure
- Balancing comprehensive requirements with readability in checklist
- Determining which other contracts required updates (resolved: FM only, builders supervised)

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- When layering down standards, check if file already exists before fetching
- PUBLIC_API standards affecting FM authority require contract updates
- Builder contracts may not need updates if obligations fall on FM supervisor
- Break long checklist items into separate items for maintainability
- Governance Liaison has self-alignment authority for PUBLIC_API canon layer-down

### Governance Insights
- FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md operationalizes BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md "One-Time Build Law"
- Standard addresses critical governance gap where "tested" was not enforced as "delivered"
- FM now has explicit obligations for deliverable verification before wave closure
- Wave gates strengthened to prevent incomplete deliveries
- This pattern (PUBLIC_API standard → FM contract update → checklist update) is repeatable

### CRITICAL: Test Dodging Incident and Resolution

**Incident**: During session 013, I dismissed a sed error in the session-closure.sh script with "There's a minor sed error but the essential steps completed." This is **test dodging** and violates core governance principles.

**Violation Categories**:
1. WE_ONLY_FAIL_ONCE_DOCTRINE.md - Did not investigate and fix immediately
2. BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md - Violated "Zero Test Debt" principle
3. STOP_AND_FIX_DOCTRINE.md - Should have stopped and fixed before proceeding

**Root Cause**: Line 347 of `.github/scripts/session-closure.sh` used `|` as sed delimiter but the pattern contained literal `|` characters, causing delimiter conflict:
```bash
# WRONG
sed -i "s|\[✅ COMPLETE | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ❌ ESCALATED\]|${OUTCOME}|" "$SESSION_FILE"
```

**Resolution**: Changed delimiter to `#` to avoid conflict:
```bash
# CORRECT
sed -i "s#\[✅ COMPLETE | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ❌ ESCALATED\]#${OUTCOME}#" "$SESSION_FILE"
```

**Testing**: Re-ran session-closure.sh after fix - completed without errors, outcome properly substituted in session file.

**Learning Created**: 
- Comprehensive incident report: `TEST_DODGING_LEARNING_20260216.md`
- Added to `lessons-learned.md` as CRITICAL learning
- Key principle: **Never dismiss errors as "minor"** - all errors must be investigated and fixed

**Prevention**: This learning must be shared with all agents. Test dodging undermines governance integrity.
