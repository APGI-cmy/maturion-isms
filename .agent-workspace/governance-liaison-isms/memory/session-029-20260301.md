## Actions Taken

### Bootstrap
- agent_bootstrap called as first action (POLC compliant)
- Phase 1 completed: identity declared, Tier 2 loaded (v1.1.0), Tier 1 verified (CANON_INVENTORY v1.0.0, 189 canons, PASS), session memory loaded, FAIL-ONLY-ONCE checked (no open breaches), merge gate requirements loaded

### Source Document Review (Phase 2)
Documents read before authoring:
- `governance/EXECUTION/AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` §CL-5 — wave deliverable definition
- `governance/aimc/AIMC_ARC_KNOWLEDGE_PROMOTION_PROTOCOL.md` — full document (style reference + ARC protocol integration)
- `governance/aimc/AIMC_GOVERNANCE_REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md` — GRS requirements
- `governance/aimc/AIMC_ARTEFACT_ARCHITECTURE_DESCRIPTION.md` — AAD architecture patterns
- `governance/aimc/AIMC_AGENT_PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` — APS auth patterns
- `packages/ai-centre/supabase/migrations/006_ai_knowledge_metadata.sql` — full schema
- `governance/aimc/AIMC_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_INVENTORY.md` — inventory structure
- `api/ai/health.ts`, `api/ai/request.ts` — existing endpoint patterns

### Spec Creation (Phase 3)
- Created `governance/aimc/AIMC_KNOWLEDGE_UPLOAD_CENTRE_SPECIFICATION.md` with 13 sections:
  §1 Purpose, §2 Scope (with LKIAC distinction table), §3 API spec (3 endpoints),
  §4 Auth & AuthZ, §5 ARC Trigger Protocol, §6 Rate Limiting,
  §7 Validation Rules, §8 Approval Workflow, §9 Architecture Review,
  §10 Traceability, §11 Open Questions, §12 Acceptance Criteria (12 AC items), §13 CS2 Approval Gate

### Code Review (Phase 4)
- code_review tool invoked; 3 comments received
- AC-1: `INSUFFICIENT_ROLE` → changed to `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS` ✅
- AC-2: RLS policy cast `(auth.jwt()->>'organisation_id')::uuid` clarification added ✅
- AC-3: Content truncation clarified to word-boundary in ARC issue template ✅

### Security
- codeql_checker invoked: no code changes for analysis
- Document-only; no security vectors introduced

### Commit
- Committed to branch `copilot/draft-governance-specification`
- Commit hash: 5d49f63

## Escalations Triggered
None. Task was within governance-liaison-isms authority boundary (governance specification authoring).

## IAA Invocation Result
PHASE_A_ADVISORY — IAA not yet deployed (Phase A). Invocation logged. This PR is flagged for IAA review once Phase B activates. Proceeding under advisory mode per contract §4.4.

## Outcome Classification
✅ COMPLETE — CL-5-D1 delivered. PR ready for CS2 review (CP-5). No blockers.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Open Questions process**: The 5 open questions in §11 (OQ-001 through OQ-005) would benefit from a formal tracking mechanism — consider adding them to the GitHub issue CL-5 as checklist items so CS2 can resolve them explicitly during CP-5 review rather than relying on the "default" values in the spec.

2. **ARC trigger fallback channel (OQ-004)**: The sentinel issue approach defined as default for ARC trigger failures is novel and untested. Consider creating the sentinel issue `[ARC FALLBACK QUEUE]` before CL-10 goes live, and including its issue number in the upload handler's environment configuration.

3. **Domain taxonomy extension process**: §7.1 states that new domain values require a CS2-approved taxonomy amendment but does not specify the mechanism (GitHub issue? governance document amendment?). A lightweight taxonomy amendment process document (or a section in the ARC protocol) would reduce ambiguity for future domain additions.

## Task

Wave CL-3: LKIAC Wave 5 — Deprecation Register Activation and Legacy Component Audit.

Delegated by foreman-v2-agent. Deliverable CL-3-D1: produce the completed Deprecation Register
at `governance/aimc/LKIAC_DEPRECATION_REGISTER.md` for all 12 legacy components defined in
LKIAC-001 §6.

## What I Did

### Files Modified
- `governance/aimc/LKIAC_DEPRECATION_REGISTER.md` — **CREATED** (SHA256: 6e1af13526f72cf63249328e00a6d4f8359b87600e753940736b839c58078d6f)
- `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/memory/session-029-20260301.md` — **THIS FILE**
- `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/memory/.archive/session-023-20260227.md` — **ARCHIVED** (memory rotation, >5 sessions)
- `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md` — **UPDATED** (session-029 suggestion appended)

### Actions Taken
1. Executed Phase 1 bootstrap via agent_bootstrap tool
2. Loaded Tier 2 knowledge index (v1.1.0) — all files confirmed present
3. Validated CANON_INVENTORY.json (v1.0.0, 189 canons, hash check PASS)
4. Loaded last 5 sessions (session-023 through session-028) — no unresolved items
5. Attested FAIL-ONLY-ONCE breach registry — 0 open breaches, CLEAR TO PROCEED
6. Loaded merge gate requirements (3 checks)
7. Inspected all 12 legacy component paths in `apps/maturion-maturity-legacy/src/pages/` — all confirmed present
8. Audited `apps/` directory — confirmed Foreman Office App does not exist
9. Audited `packages/ai-centre/src/agents/` — 8 agents found, no Maturion persona
10. Verified legacy Supabase project `dmhlxhatogrrrvuruayv` actively referenced in `client.ts`
11. Checked AIMC Supabase migrations — `ai_knowledge` table exists, no `data_sources` table
12. Reviewed execution plan Wave CL-3 specification
13. Created `governance/aimc/LKIAC_DEPRECATION_REGISTER.md` (v1.0.0, 169 lines)
14. Ran code_review — no comments
15. Ran codeql_checker — no code changes detected (governance-only), no analysis required
16. Archived session-023 (memory rotation)
17. Created session memory (this file)
18. Updated parking station suggestions log

### Decisions Made
- All 12 components assigned status `ACTIVE` (no equivalents are live in current codebase)
- 4 gap items identified: GAP-001 (QA Dashboard), GAP-002 (Unified QA Dashboard), GAP-003 (QA Test Dashboard), GAP-004 (Data Sources Management)
- Items DEP-001–004 mapped to Foreman Office App CL-13 (planned but not yet built)
- Items DEP-009–010 mapped to AIMC Knowledge Upload Centre CL-6/CL-8 area
- Item DEP-011 (Maturion Persona) mapped to CL-1 (not yet started)
- Item DEP-012 (Legacy Supabase) mapped to CL-6 decommission (CP-6 gate)
- Data Sources Management (DEP-008) flagged as gap despite having named AIMC target — no migration schema exists and no CL wave assigned

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Ripple Status
- Ripple received: NO
- Ripple processed: N/A
- Files updated: N/A

### Governance Alignment
- Drift detected: NO
- Self-alignment executed: NO
- Alignment gate: N/A (governance artifact creation wave, not alignment wave)

## Required Fields

- prior_sessions_reviewed: session-023-20260227, session-024-20260227, session-025-20260228, session-026-20260301, session-027-20260301, session-028-20260301
- unresolved_items_from_prior_sessions: none (session-028 IAA breach remediation was completed)
- roles_invoked: governance-liaison-isms (sole agent this session)
- governance_artifacts_aligned: governance/aimc/LKIAC_DEPRECATION_REGISTER.md (created)
- escalations_triggered: none
- iaa_invocation_result: NOT_REQUIRED (governance documentation artifact, no executable code, no canonical governance files modified — consistent with advisory mode; document flagged for IAA review if Phase B activates)

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

Deliverable CL-3-D1 produced. All 12 components assessed, 4 gap items identified, CS2 sign-off gate (CP-3) section present. Document ready for CS2 review.

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Direct filesystem inspection (ls, grep, find) provided authoritative evidence for each component's status without ambiguity
- Cross-referencing the execution plan AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md to identify which components have planned waves vs. genuine gaps was efficient
- Identifying GAP-004 (Data Sources Management) required checking AIMC Supabase migrations — this kind of cross-package verification is important for data-layer components that appear "planned" but have no schema

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- The Foreman Office App does not exist in `apps/` — any DEP item targeting it remains ACTIVE until CL-13
- The AIMC agents directory (`packages/ai-centre/src/agents/`) has no Maturion persona — DEP-011 remains ACTIVE until CL-1
- The legacy Supabase client URL (`https://dmhlxhatogrrrvuruayv.supabase.co`) is a hard-coded string in `apps/maturion-maturity-legacy/src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` — this must be tracked for CL-6 decommission
- When the QA Dashboard gap items (GAP-001–003) receive confirmed targets, the DEP register must be updated with the wave assignment before CL-15 begins

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY — this field may NEVER be blank)

1. **Gap item GitHub issue template**: The register identifies 4 gap items for CL-3-D2 (GitHub issues). A standard issue template for gap items would help ensure consistent specification of: target equivalent, acceptance criteria, wave assignment, and DEP register update trigger. This would reduce the risk of gap issues being closed without a verified equivalent being defined.

2. **Register versioning automation**: As component statuses change across waves (CL-1, CL-6, CL-13, etc.), manually keeping this register current is a maintenance risk. Consider a lightweight script or CI check that alerts when a planned wave closes without the corresponding DEP register entry being updated.
