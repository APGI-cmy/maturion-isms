## Actions Taken

### Bootstrap
- agent_bootstrap called as first action (POLC compliant)
- Phase 1 completed: identity declared, Tier 2 loaded (v1.1.0), Tier 1 verified (CANON_INVENTORY v1.0.0, 189 canons, PASS), session memory loaded, FAIL-ONLY-ONCE checked (no open breaches), merge gate requirements loaded

### Source Document Review (Phase 2)
Documents read before authoring:
- `governance/EXECUTION/AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` §CL-5 — wave deliverable definition
- `governance/aimc/AIMC_ARC_KNOWLEDGE_PROMOTION_PROTOCOL.md` — full document (style reference + ARC protocol integration)
- `governance/aimc/AIMC_GOVERNANCE_REQUIREMENTS_SPECIFICATION.md` — GRS requirements
- `governance/aimc/AIMC_ARTEFACT_ARCHITECTURE_DESCRIPTION.md` — AAD architecture patterns
- `governance/aimc/AIMC_AGENT_PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION.md` — APS auth patterns
- `packages/ai-centre/supabase/migrations/006_ai_knowledge_metadata.sql` — full schema
- `governance/aimc/AIMC_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_INVENTORY.md` — inventory structure
- `api/ai/health.ts`, `api/ai/request.ts` — existing endpoint patterns

### Spec Creation (Phase 3)
- Created `governance/aimc/AIMC_KNOWLEDGE_UPLOAD_CENTRE_SPECIFICATION.md` with 13 sections:
  §1 Purpose, §2 Scope (with LKIAC distinction table), §3 API spec (3 endpoints),
  §4 Auth & AuthZ, §5 ARC Trigger Protocol, §6 Rate Limiting,
  §7 Validation Rules, §8 Approval Workflow, §9 Architecture Review,
  §10 Traceability, §11 Open Questions, §12 Acceptance Criteria (12 AC items), §13 CS2 Approval Gate

### Code Review (Phase 4)
- code_review tool invoked; 3 comments received
- AC-1: `INSUFFICIENT_ROLE` → changed to `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS` ✅
- AC-2: RLS policy cast `(auth.jwt()->>'organisation_id')::uuid` clarification added ✅
- AC-3: Content truncation clarified to word-boundary in ARC issue template ✅

### Security
- codeql_checker invoked: no code changes for analysis
- Document-only; no security vectors introduced

### Commit
- Committed to branch `copilot/draft-governance-specification`
- Commit hash: 5d49f63

## Escalations Triggered
None. Task was within governance-liaison-isms authority boundary (governance specification authoring).

## IAA Invocation Result
PHASE_A_ADVISORY — IAA not yet deployed (Phase A). Invocation logged. This PR is flagged for IAA review once Phase B activates. Proceeding under advisory mode per contract §4.4.

## Outcome Classification
✅ COMPLETE — CL-5-D1 delivered. PR ready for CS2 review (CP-5). No blockers.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Open Questions process**: The 5 open questions in §11 (OQ-001 through OQ-005) would benefit from a formal tracking mechanism — consider adding them to the GitHub issue CL-5 as checklist items so CS2 can resolve them explicitly during CP-5 review rather than relying on the "default" values in the spec.

2. **ARC trigger fallback channel (OQ-004)**: The sentinel issue approach defined as default for ARC trigger failures is novel and untested. Consider creating the sentinel issue `[ARC FALLBACK QUEUE]` before CL-10 goes live, and including its issue number in the upload handler's environment configuration.

3. **Domain taxonomy extension process**: §7.1 states that new domain values require a CS2-approved taxonomy amendment but does not specify the mechanism (GitHub issue? governance document amendment?). A lightweight taxonomy amendment process document (or a section in the ARC protocol) would reduce ambiguity for future domain additions.
