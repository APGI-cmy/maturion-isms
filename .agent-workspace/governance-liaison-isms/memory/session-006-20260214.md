### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **NEVER dismiss validation errors as "expected"** - always investigate
2. **"Tests are not suggestions"** - BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md
3. **Investigate before assuming** - categorize systematically
4. **Fix within scope immediately** - don't mark complete until clean
5. **Provide evidence** - before/after validation required
6. **Test dodging is governance violation** - requires full corrective action
7. **Agent contract format matters** - Living Agent System v6.2.0 has specific schema
8. **Zero tolerance for assumptions** - "expected" errors need investigation

### Governance Insights
1. Living Agent System v6.2.0 schema enforcement working
2. Governance liaison self-alignment authority effective
