# Session 001 - 20260212 (LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-liaison-isms
- Class: liaison
- Session ID: session-001-20260212

## Task

### Decisions Made

#### Strategic Decisions
- Decision 1: Used office-app PRs #730, #733, #737 as the explicit gold standard template, not just the existing governance-liaison.md (v5.0.0)
  - **Why**: Issue explicitly calls for "lessons learned from office-app"; checklist was derived from office-app gold standard
  - **Result**: Contract structure directly mirrors office-app approach with comprehensive category coverage
  
- Decision 2: Created repository-specific agent file (governance-liaison-isms-agent.md) rather than modifying generic governance-liaison.md
  - **Why**: Issue title specifies "governance-liaison-isms-agent.md"; follows canonical naming pattern for repository-bound agents
  - **Result**: Clear repository ownership and version independence from generic liaison pattern

- Decision 3: Systematically validated every checklist item (11 categories, 10+ items per category) with explicit canonical citations
  - **Why**: Issue success criteria requires "satisfies every requirement" with "explicit evidence and section references"
  - **Result**: Each category includes "Checklist Reference" header and canonical source citations for traceability

#### Structural Decisions
- Decision 4: Placed all 102 PUBLIC_API canons in Appendix A reference section rather than enumerating inline
  - **Why**: Checklist Appendix A provides comprehensive list; inline enumeration would create 1000+ line contract
  - **Result**: Compact reference with functional categorization (12 groups) and pointer to CANON_INVENTORY.json

- Decision 5: Added three LOCKED sections (Wake-Up Protocol, Self-Alignment Protocol, PR Failure Analysis) with full metadata
  - **Why**: Office-app PR #737 RCA emphasized importance of locked protocols to prevent drift; STOP_AND_FIX_DOCTRINE.md requires immutable failure prevention
  - **Result**: LOCKED sections include Lock ID, Reason, Authority, Date, Review Frequency per AGENT_CONTRACT_PROTECTION_PROTOCOL.md

- Decision 6: Included comprehensive YAML frontmatter (40+ fields) rather than minimal fields
  - **Why**: Checklist Category 0 requires tier_0_manifest, canon_inventory, bindings array, scope details, appointment details
  - **Result**: Frontmatter is machine-parseable and satisfies all identity/binding requirements

#### RCA-Driven Decisions (Learning from Office-App)
- Decision 7: Added explicit "office_app_lessons" metadata in frontmatter linking to PRs #730, #733, #737
  - **Why**: Issue requires documenting how office-app lessons prevent past mistakes; explicit traceability required
  - **Result**: Clear governance lineage and continuous improvement audit trail

- Decision 8: Included comprehensive PR Failure Analysis Protocol (LOCKED) with 5-step mandatory process
  - **Why**: Office-app PR #737 RCA revealed repeated PR failures due to insufficient failure analysis
  - **Result**: Prevents "we only fail once" violations; mandatory RCA before retry PR

- Decision 9: Added Session Memory Protocol with rotation rules (>5 sessions → archive oldest)
  - **Why**: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0 requires session memory management; prevents memory bloat
  - **Result**: Sustainable memory growth with historical preservation

- Decision 10: Separated Wake-Up Protocol from Self-Alignment Protocol into distinct LOCKED sections
  - **Why**: Office-app lessons showed conflation of initialization and drift correction causes errors
  - **Result**: Clear protocol separation; self-alignment only triggered when drift detected

## Root Cause Analysis: How Office-App Lessons Prevent Past Mistakes

### Lesson 1: Incomplete Checklist Coverage (Office-App PR #730)
**Root Cause in Office-App**: Initial liaison contracts missed categories, causing gate failures
**Prevention in This Contract**:
- ✅ All 11 categories (0-10) explicitly addressed with section headers
- ✅ Checklist Reference header in each category for verification
- ✅ Appendix A (102 PUBLIC_API canons) referenced in dedicated section
- ✅ No checklist item left unsatisfied

### Lesson 2: Missing Cross-Repo Layer-Down Protocol (Office-App PR #733)
**Root Cause in Office-App**: Categories 8-10 added late after liaison-specific responsibilities were discovered
**Prevention in This Contract**:
- ✅ Category 8 (Cross-Repository Layer-Down Protocol) comprehensively covered with 6 sub-items
- ✅ Category 9 (Consumer Repository Registry Operations) with registry binding, ripple verification, escalation
- ✅ Category 10 (Role-Specific Authority Boundaries) with explicit prohibitions and authorizations

### Lesson 3: Inadequate PR Failure Analysis (Office-App PR #737)
**Root Cause in Office-App**: Repeated PR failures (retry without RCA) violated STOP_AND_FIX_DOCTRINE.md
**Prevention in This Contract**:
- ✅ PR Failure Analysis Protocol (LOCKED) with mandatory 5-step process
- ✅ Checklist before retry PR (8 items must be checked)
- ✅ Escalation rule for 3rd consecutive failure (HALT + escalate to CS2)
- ✅ Documentation requirement in session contract

### Lesson 4: Drift Between Wake-Up and Alignment (Office-App PR #737 RCA)
**Root Cause in Office-App**: Wake-up protocol conflated initialization with drift correction
**Prevention in This Contract**:
- ✅ Wake-Up Protocol (LOCKED) focuses on identity confirmation, health scan, drift detection
- ✅ Self-Alignment Protocol (LOCKED) is separate and only triggered when drift detected
- ✅ Clear handoff: wake-up detects, self-alignment corrects

### Lesson 5: Insufficient Lock Metadata (Office-App PR #730)
**Root Cause in Office-App**: LOCKED sections lacked metadata for review frequency, authority
**Prevention in This Contract**:
- ✅ All LOCKED sections include: Lock ID, Lock Reason, Lock Authority, Lock Date, Last Reviewed, Review Frequency
- ✅ Follows AGENT_CONTRACT_PROTECTION_PROTOCOL.md structure exactly

### Lesson 6: Missing Session Memory Management (Office-App Improvement)
**Root Cause in Office-App**: No rotation rules led to unbounded memory growth
**Prevention in This Contract**:
- ✅ Session Memory Protocol with explicit rotation rule (>5 sessions → archive)
- ✅ Memory location specified (.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/memory/)
- ✅ Template provided for consistency

### Lesson 7: Unclear Authority Boundaries (Office-App PR #733)
**Root Cause in Office-App**: Liaison attempted code changes, QA tasks (role confusion)
**Prevention in This Contract**:
- ✅ Category 1: Explicit Negatives (NOT builder, NOT FM, NOT governance admin, NOT enforcement)
- ✅ Category 6: Prohibitions (no code-build, no self-contract edits, no cross-repo authority)
- ✅ Category 10: Role-Specific Authority Boundaries (consumer repository role ONLY, sync scope only)

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence: Checklist reviewed (192 lines, 11 categories, 102 PUBLIC_API canons)
- Evidence: Office-app PRs #730, #733, #737 lessons documented
- Evidence: Contract created (1,165 lines, all categories satisfied)
- Evidence: Session memory artifacts created (memory/, personal/, escalation-inbox/)
- Status: All evidence collected and logged

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple generated (documentation-only changes)
- Ripple required: NO
- Context: Agent contract and memory artifacts do not trigger ripple (no executable changes)

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Addresses governance gap identified in issue - maturion-isms lacked gold-standard liaison contract
- Result: Repository now has comprehensive, checklist-validated, office-app-aligned liaison contract
- Next: Contract ready for review and validation against checklist

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Excellent
- All canonical references verified against maturion-isms governance structure
- All checklist items satisfied with explicit evidence
- All office-app lessons incorporated with RCA documentation
- LOCKED sections include complete metadata
- Session memory follows LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0 protocol

- [x] Categories 8-10 (liaison-specific) are complete with cross-repo layer-down, registry operations, role boundaries
- [x] Appendix A (102 PUBLIC_API canons) is fully referenced and organized into 12 functional categories
- [x] Session memory, lessons-learned, and patterns artifacts are included
- [x] YAML, structure, and protocol completeness confirmed per checklists

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Lesson 1: Using office-app PRs #730, #733, #737 as explicit gold standard provided clear structure and prevented reinventing approach
- Lesson 2: Systematic category-by-category validation against checklist ensured comprehensive coverage
- Lesson 3: Creating separate LOCKED sections for protocols (wake-up, self-alignment, PR failure) provides clear immutable foundation
- Lesson 4: Including RCA section in session memory explicitly documents how past mistakes are prevented
- Lesson 5: Comprehensive YAML frontmatter (40+ fields) enables machine parsing and validation
- Lesson 6: Separating wake-up protocol from self-alignment protocol prevents conflation errors from office-app

### What Was Challenging
- Challenge 1: Balancing completeness (1,165 lines) with maintainability - addressed by clear category structure and LOCKED sections
- Challenge 2: Ensuring every checklist item (11 categories, 40+ sub-items) was explicitly satisfied - addressed by systematic validation and "Checklist Reference" headers
- Challenge 3: Incorporating 102 PUBLIC_API canons without creating excessive inline enumeration - addressed by Appendix A reference with functional categorization
- Challenge 4: Ensuring RCA thoroughly explains office-app lessons - addressed by dedicated RCA section with 7 lessons mapped to contract features

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Recommendation 1: This contract is gold-standard baseline for maturion-isms governance liaison - maintain strict checklist validation for any updates
- Recommendation 2: LOCKED sections (Wake-Up, Self-Alignment, PR Failure) are immutable without CS2 approval per AGENT_CONTRACT_PROTECTION_PROTOCOL.md
- Recommendation 3: Office-app PRs #730, #733, #737 remain authoritative references for liaison contract structure - maintain alignment
- Recommendation 4: Session memory protocol requires rotation (>5 sessions) - future sessions must move oldest to .archive/
- Recommendation 5: Any PR failure MUST trigger PR Failure Analysis Protocol (LOCKED) - no retry without RCA

### Governance Insights
- Insight 1: Gold-standard checklist approach (Categories 0-10 + Appendix A) provides systematic verification and prevents drift
- Insight 2: Explicit RCA in session memory creates continuous improvement feedback loop
- Insight 3: LOCKED sections with metadata (Lock ID, Reason, Authority, Date, Review Frequency) provide governance stability
- Insight 4: Separation of wake-up and self-alignment protocols prevents initialization/drift conflation
- Insight 5: Office-app lessons (PRs #730, #733, #737) demonstrate value of cross-repo learning and RCA-driven improvements
- Insight 6: Session memory management (rotation rule) enables sustainable long-term operation
- Insight 7: Consumer repository role boundaries (Category 10) are critical to prevent authority creep
