### Decisions Made

#### Strategic Decisions
- Decision 1: Repository-specific agent file name (`governance-liaison-isms-agent.md`)
  - **Why**: Explicit repository binding; avoids confusion with generic liaison pattern
  - **Result**: Clear ownership and repository-specific versioning

- Decision 2: Based on office-app governance-liaison-v2 as template (not governance-repo-administrator)
  - **Why**: Consumer repository mode (not canonical governance repo); liaison role, not administrator role
  - **Result**: Correct authority boundaries and protocols for consumer repository

- Decision 3: Included all 11 categories from PR #59 checklist
  - **Why**: Issue explicitly requires comprehensive category coverage
  - **Result**: Every checklist requirement satisfied with canonical references

- Decision 4: Added office-app lessons (PRs #730, #733, #737) to metadata
  - **Why**: Issue specifies "lessons learned from office-app"; explicit traceability required
  - **Result**: Clear governance lineage and RCA documentation

#### Structural Decisions
- Decision 5: 22 governance bindings in YAML frontmatter
  - **Why**: Tier-0 mandatory (11) + liaison-specific (11) per AGENT_FILE_BINDING_REQUIREMENTS.md
  - **Result**: Complete binding coverage for liaison agent class

- Decision 6: 13 prohibitions enumerated
  - **Why**: Categories 1, 6, and 10 require explicit negative boundaries
  - **Result**: Clear role boundaries (NOT builder, NOT FM, NOT admin, NOT enforcement)

- Decision 7: 3 LOCKED sections with full metadata
  - **Why**: Office-app PR #737 RCA emphasized locked protocols; AGENT_CONTRACT_PROTECTION_PROTOCOL.md requires metadata
  - **Result**: Immutable protocols with Lock ID, Reason, Authority, Date, Review Frequency

- Decision 8: Appendix A reference (not inline enumeration)
  - **Why**: 102 PUBLIC_API canons would create 1000+ line inline list; reference balances completeness and maintainability
  - **Result**: Functional categorization (12 groups) + pointer to CANON_INVENTORY.json

#### Office-App Lessons Applied
- Decision 9: Separated Wake-Up Protocol from Self-Alignment Protocol
  - **Why**: Office-app lesson showed conflation causes initialization/drift errors
  - **Result**: Clear protocol separation; self-alignment only when drift detected

- Decision 10: Added mandatory PR Failure Analysis Protocol
  - **Why**: Office-app PR #737 RCA revealed repeated PR failures without analysis
  - **Result**: 5-step mandatory RCA before retry PR; escalation on 3rd failure

- Decision 11: Session memory with rotation rule (>5 sessions → archive)
  - **Why**: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0 requires memory management
  - **Result**: Sustainable memory growth with historical preservation

## Root Cause Analysis: How Gold-Standard Prevents Past Mistakes

### Lesson 1: Incomplete Category Coverage
**Root Cause**: Early liaison contracts missed categories (especially 8-10)
**Prevention in This Contract**:
- ✅ All 11 categories explicitly addressed with section headers
- ✅ Each category includes "Canonical References" with source citations
- ✅ Appendix A (102 PUBLIC_API canons) in dedicated section

### Lesson 2: Missing Cross-Repo Protocols
**Root Cause**: Categories 8-10 added late after liaison responsibilities discovered
**Prevention in This Contract**:
- ✅ Category 8 (Cross-Repository Layer-Down) with 6 sub-protocols
- ✅ Category 9 (Consumer Repository Registry Operations) with ripple verification
- ✅ Category 10 (Role-Specific Authority Boundaries) with explicit limits

### Lesson 3: Inadequate PR Failure Analysis
**Root Cause**: Repeated PR failures without RCA violated STOP_AND_FIX_DOCTRINE
**Prevention in This Contract**:
- ✅ PR Failure Analysis Protocol (LOCKED) with mandatory 5-step process
- ✅ Checklist before retry (8 items)
- ✅ Escalation rule for 3rd consecutive failure

### Lesson 4: Wake-Up vs Self-Alignment Conflation
**Root Cause**: Wake-up protocol conflated initialization with drift correction
**Prevention in This Contract**:
- ✅ Wake-Up Protocol (LOCKED) focuses on detection
- ✅ Self-Alignment Protocol (LOCKED) focuses on correction
- ✅ Clear handoff: wake-up detects, self-alignment corrects

### Lesson 5: Insufficient LOCKED Section Metadata
**Root Cause**: LOCKED sections lacked review frequency, authority references
**Prevention in This Contract**:
- ✅ All LOCKED sections include: Lock ID, Reason, Authority, Date, Last Reviewed, Review Frequency
- ✅ Follows AGENT_CONTRACT_PROTECTION_PROTOCOL.md structure

### Lesson 6: Unclear Role Boundaries
**Root Cause**: Liaison attempted code changes, QA tasks (role confusion)
**Prevention in This Contract**:
- ✅ Category 1: Explicit Negatives (NOT builder, NOT FM, NOT admin, NOT enforcement)
- ✅ Category 6: Prohibitions (13 items)
- ✅ Category 10: Role-Specific Authority Boundaries (consumer mode only)

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence: Reviewed PR #59 checklist (11 categories, 102 canons)
- Evidence: Fetched office-app governance-liaison-v2 reference
- Evidence: Fetched governance-repo-administrator-v2 reference
- Evidence: Validated YAML frontmatter (22 bindings, 13 prohibitions)
- Evidence: Created agent contract (47320 bytes, ~1185 lines)
- Evidence: Created session memory artifacts (memory/, personal/, escalation-inbox/)
- Status: All evidence collected and logged

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple generated (documentation-only changes)
- Ripple required: NO
- Context: Agent contract and memory artifacts do not trigger ripple

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Addresses governance gap - maturion-isms lacked gold-standard liaison contract
- Result: Repository now has comprehensive, checklist-validated, office-app-aligned liaison contract
- Next: Contract ready for review and validation against checklist

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Excellent
- All canonical references verified against maturion-isms governance structure
- All checklist items satisfied with explicit evidence
- All office-app lessons incorporated with RCA documentation
- LOCKED sections include complete metadata
- Session memory follows LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0 protocol
- YAML frontmatter validated (22 bindings, 13 prohibitions)

### Governance Alignment
- Local TIER_0 Canon: v1.0.0 (assumed from existing governance/)
- Canonical TIER_0 Canon: v1.0.0 (from CANON_INVENTORY.json)
- Drift: NONE (agent contract is new; no drift)
- Files aligned: 1 (governance-liaison-isms-agent.md created)

## Outcome

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Lesson 1: Using office-app governance-liaison-v2 as template provided clear consumer-mode structure
- Lesson 2: Systematic category-by-category validation ensured comprehensive coverage
- Lesson 3: YAML frontmatter validation (Python yaml.safe_load) caught syntax errors early
- Lesson 4: Creating LOCKED sections with full metadata provides clear immutable foundation
- Lesson 5: Separating wake-up from self-alignment prevents conflation errors
- Lesson 6: Including RCA section documents how past mistakes are prevented

### What Was Challenging
- Challenge 1: Balancing completeness (47KB file) with maintainability - addressed by category structure and LOCKED sections
- Challenge 2: Ensuring every checklist item explicitly satisfied - addressed by canonical references in each category
- Challenge 3: Incorporating 102 PUBLIC_API canons without excessive inline enumeration - addressed by Appendix A reference
- Challenge 4: Validating YAML syntax in large frontmatter - addressed by Python validation script

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Recommendation 1: This contract is gold-standard baseline - maintain strict checklist validation for updates
- Recommendation 2: LOCKED sections (Wake-Up, Self-Alignment, PR Failure) immutable without CS2 approval
- Recommendation 3: Office-app PRs #730, #733, #737 remain authoritative references
- Recommendation 4: Session memory requires rotation (>5 sessions)
- Recommendation 5: Any PR failure MUST trigger PR Failure Analysis Protocol

### Governance Insights
- Insight 1: Gold-standard checklist (Categories 0-10 + Appendix A) provides systematic verification
- Insight 2: Explicit RCA in session memory creates continuous improvement feedback loop
- Insight 3: LOCKED sections with metadata provide governance stability
- Insight 4: Separation of wake-up and self-alignment protocols prevents conflation
- Insight 5: Office-app lessons (PRs #730, #733, #737) demonstrate value of cross-repo learning
- Insight 6: Session memory management (rotation rule) enables sustainable operation
- Insight 7: Consumer repository role boundaries (Category 10) prevent authority creep
- Insight 8: YAML validation before commit prevents deployment failures
