- Contract Version: 3.0.0

## Task
Review all recently layered-down governance PRs (#422, #424, #430) since AIMC canonization. Verify correct files and structures were layered down, trigger governance ripple protocol, confirm AIMC canon integration, and document ripple completion.

## What I Did

### Ripple Review: PRs #422, #424, #430

#### PR #422 — Canonical commit `a4e4513`
- **Drift report**: `.agent-admin/governance/drift-report-align-20260215-045927.md`
- **Files layered down**: 60 (initial full sync after governance bootstrapping)
- **Verification**: Full initial governance canon sync. All files align with CANON_INVENTORY.json entries at time of sync.
- **Agent files affected**: No
- **AIMC**: Not in this batch (pre-AIMC canonization)
- **Ripple status**: ✅ COMPLETE — no consumer structures needed updating beyond what was in the PR

#### PR #424 — Canonical commit `930a5d0`
- **Drift report**: `.agent-admin/governance/drift-report-align-20260223-085750.md`
- **Files layered down**: 3 (`governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json`, `governance/sync_state.json`, and related)
- **Verification**: `sync_state.json` updated to canonical commit `930a5d0ef893e7edba49b3db92747b699fb1a90b`. CANON_INVENTORY hash updated. SHA256 verified via alignment script.
- **Agent files affected**: No
- **AIMC**: CANON_INVENTORY contains AIMC-referenced entries — confirmed present
- **Ripple status**: ✅ COMPLETE — metadata update only, no consumer structure changes required

#### PR #430 — Canonical commit `6cd642c`
- **Drift report**: `.agent-admin/governance/drift-report-align-20260223-100529.md`
- **Files layered down**: 3
  - `governance/canon/GOVERNANCE_LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md` (NEW file)
  - `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` (updated to 177 entries)
  - `governance/sync_state.json` (updated canonical commit)
- **Verification**: `GOVERNANCE_LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md` is now present locally. CANON_INVENTORY reflects 177 total canon files. SHA256 checksums verified.
- **Agent files affected**: No
- **AIMC**: CANON_INVENTORY.json now at 177 entries — AIMC strategy and management centre files are catalogued in the inventory.
- **Ripple status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### AIMC Integration Confirmation

Reviewed CANON_INVENTORY.json (177 entries, v1.0.0):
- AIMC-related governance artefacts are present in the inventory
- No AIMC-specific files were missed in PRs #422, #424, #430
- Issue #1185 (CANON_INVENTORY systemic fix) and PR #1184 (AIMC canonization systemic patch) addressed AIMC integration in prior sessions (session-013, session-014)
- Current state: AIMC canon fully integrated and referenced in CANON_INVENTORY.json

### Layer-Down Automation Gap Awareness

Reviewed investigation findings from Foreman session 051:
- Root cause: Both `governance-alignment-schedule.yml` and `governance-ripple-sync.yml` were creating PRs directly without emitting GitHub issues with `governance` + `layer-down` labels
- This prevented `ripple-integration.yml` from firing and the governance liaison from being formally assigned
- Fix: Both workflows now create governance liaison issues; `ripple-integration.yml` has duplicate-PR prevention

### Internal Ripple Actions

No additional consumer files required updating. The layered-down files in PRs #422, #424, #430 are:
1. Metadata files (`sync_state.json`, `CANON_INVENTORY.json`) — self-contained
2. New canon file (`GOVERNANCE_LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md`) — no dependent consumer structures require immediate update

Cross-references verified:
- `governance/sync_state.json` ✅ points to current canonical commit
- `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` ✅ 177 entries, v1.0.0

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Idempotency guard on liaison issue creation**: The new issue-creation step in `governance-alignment-schedule.yml` should check for existing open `layer-down` issues before creating a new one, to prevent issue accumulation during rapid successive hourly runs.

2. **Liaison acknowledgement step in workflow**: Add a step in `ripple-integration.yml` that auto-comments on the liaison issue after ripple completion, providing structured evidence of completion.
