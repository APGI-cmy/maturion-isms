# Session 014 - 20260218 (LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-liaison-isms
- Class: liaison
- Session ID: session-014-20260218
- Contract Version: 3.0.0

## Task
Execute governance ripple to align consumer files with the last 9 layer-down updates from canonical governance repository. Specifically, review recent governance alignment PRs and identify which consumer files (agent contracts, progress trackers, implementation plans, workflows) need updates to align with governance changes.

## What I Did

### Files Modified
- `governance/templates/PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md` (SHA256: to be calculated)
- `governance/checklists/BUILDER_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` (SHA256: to be calculated)
- `governance/checklists/FOREMAN_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` (SHA256: to be calculated)

### Actions Taken

#### 1. Wake-Up Protocol Execution
- Executed `.github/scripts/wake-up-protocol.sh governance-liaison-isms`
- ✅ All health checks PASSED
- ✅ No governance drift detected
- ✅ Loaded last 5 session memories

#### 2. Layer-Down PR Analysis
Reviewed 9 most recent closed governance alignment PRs:
- PR #334: Sync state timestamp update only
- **PR #333**: **CRITICAL** - Updated `FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md`
- PR #331: Sync state timestamp update only
- PR #330: Sync state timestamp update only
- PR #329: Sync state timestamp update only
- PR #328: Sync state timestamp update only
- PR #327: Sync state timestamp update only
- PR #326: Added `WAVES_5_TO_7_INFRA_FE_WIRING_LESSONS.md` (informational canon)
- PR #325: Sync state timestamp update only

**Key Finding**: Only PR #333 contained substantive governance changes requiring ripple execution.

#### 3. Governance Change Analysis (PR #333)

**Canonical File Changed**: `governance/canon/FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md`

**Changes Made** (Governance Policy Reversal):
- Removed lint validation requirement from Section 3.3 Quality Verification
- Removed type-check validation requirement from Section 3.3 Quality Verification
- Removed build validation requirement from Section 3.3 Quality Verification
- Removed lint/type-check/build from Section 4.2 Validation Evidence Required
- Removed specific lint/type-check language from Section 5.3 Quality Completeness
- Removed Section 11.4 "Code Quality Gate Bypass" (entire section deleted)

**Simplified To**:
- "100% GREEN tests (zero test debt)"
- "All TRS quality standards met"
- General build/deployment capability verification

**Historical Context**:
Earlier on 2026-02-18, evidence files show lint/type-check/build gates were ADDED to governance:
- `LINT_STATIC_ANALYSIS_GATE_GOVERNANCE_UPDATE_EVIDENCE.md`
- `PREHANDOVER_PROOF_LINT_STATIC_ANALYSIS_GATE.md`
- `FOREMAN_HANDOVER_LINT_STATIC_ANALYSIS_GATE.md`

PR #333 represents a REVERSAL of that policy a few hours later. Historical evidence files preserved unchanged as they document what was true at that specific timestamp.

#### 4. Consumer File Identification

**Comprehensive Search Executed**:
- Searched all agent contracts: No direct lint/type-check references found
- Searched progress trackers: No quality gate references requiring updates
- Searched implementation plans: No pre-handover updates needed
- Searched workflows: No governance standard references requiring updates
- Searched governance templates and checklists: **3 files identified**

**Consumer Files Requiring Updates**:
1. `governance/templates/PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md`
2. `governance/checklists/BUILDER_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`
3. `governance/checklists/FOREMAN_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`

#### 5. Ripple Execution

**File 1: PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md**
- ❌ Removed Gate 5: Linting (Zero Errors/Warnings)
- ❌ Removed Gate 6: Type-Check (Zero Errors)
- ✅ Renumbered Gate 7 → Gate 5: Governance Artifact Integrity
- ✅ Renumbered Gate 8 → Gate 6: Agent-Class Specific Gates
- ✅ Updated Evidence Artifacts checklist:
  - Removed: "Lint reports (0 errors/warnings)"
  - Removed: "Type-check reports (0 errors, if applicable)"
  - Added: "Quality metrics (per TRS standards)"
  - Clarified: "Test results (100% GREEN, zero test debt)"
- ✅ Updated Handover Certification (items 1, 4-6):
  - Removed: "lint + type-check + build" from item 1
  - Removed: item 4 "Lint validation: 0 errors and 0 warnings"
  - Removed: item 5 "Type-check validation: 0 errors (if applicable)"
  - Removed: item 6 "Build validation: Success with 0 errors"
  - Added: item 4 "All tests pass (100% GREEN, zero test debt)"
  - Added: item 5 "Build validation: Success"
  - Added: item 6 "All TRS quality standards met"

**File 2: BUILDER_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md**
- Line 57: PREHANDOVER evidence requirement
- ❌ Removed: "lint validation (0 errors/warnings), type-check validation (0 errors if applicable)"
- ✅ Added: "zero test debt, quality metrics (per TRS standards)"
- ✅ Aligned with updated PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md

**File 3: FOREMAN_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md**
- Line 44: Wave Completion Gate
  - ❌ Removed: "0 lint errors/warnings + 0 type errors"
  - ✅ Added: "zero test debt, all TRS quality standards met"
- Line 45: Wave Closure Certification
  - ❌ Removed: "including all static analysis gates"
  - ✅ Aligned with FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md Section 4.3

#### 6. Final Verification

**Comprehensive Search for Remaining References**:
- Pattern: "lint.*0 errors.*0 warnings" → No consumer files found
- Pattern: "type-check.*0 errors" → No consumer files found
- Pattern: "Code Quality Gate Bypass" → Only historical evidence files
- Pattern: "Section 11.4" → Confirmed removed section only in historical evidence

**Result**: ✅ All consumer files aligned. No further ripple required.

### Decisions Made

1. **Historical Evidence Preservation**: Did NOT modify historical evidence files documenting when lint/type-check gates were added earlier on 2026-02-18. These files serve as accurate historical record of governance state at that timestamp.

2. **Scope Assessment**: Determined ripple scope is minimal (3 consumer files) and manageable in single wave. No escalation required.

3. **Alignment Strategy**: Simplified quality language to align with FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md:
   - "100% GREEN tests, zero test debt"
   - "All TRS quality standards met"
   - General build/deployment capability
   - Removed specific tool commands (yarn lint, pnpm type-check, etc.)

4. **Self-Alignment**: Executed ripple updates within governance liaison authority boundaries (template and checklist updates, not agent contract modifications).

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

**Summary**: Successfully executed governance ripple for PR #333 FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md updates. Identified and updated 3 consumer files (1 template, 2 checklists) to align with simplified quality verification requirements (removed specific lint/type-check/build gates, aligned with "100% GREEN, zero test debt, TRS quality standards met" language). Preserved 3 historical evidence files unchanged. No escalation required. Ripple scope minimal and complete.

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Wake-up protocol**: Comprehensive health checks provided clean starting state
2. **GitHub MCP tools**: Efficiently reviewed PRs and identified substantive changes
3. **Pattern-based search**: grep/glob tools effectively identified all affected consumer files
4. **Historical evidence preservation**: Correctly recognized that evidence files document point-in-time truth

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **Governance Policy Reversals**: When governance changes are reversed shortly after being implemented, historical evidence files should be preserved as they document the accurate state at that timestamp. Only consumer files (templates, checklists) need ripple updates.

2. **Quality Gate Language Evolution**: The governance moved from specific tool requirements ("yarn lint", "pnpm type-check") to principle-based requirements ("100% GREEN tests", "TRS quality standards met"). This provides flexibility while maintaining quality standards.

3. **Ripple Scope Assessment**: Use comprehensive grep/glob searches with pattern matching to identify all affected files. Historical evidence files should be excluded from ripple (they document past state, not current requirements).

4. **Agent Contracts vs Templates**: Agent contracts in `.github/agents/*.md` may reference governance canons but typically don't embed specific quality gate commands. Templates and checklists are more likely to need ripple updates when quality standards change.

5. **Layer-Down vs Ripple**: Layer-down updates `governance/canon/*` files from canonical source. Ripple updates consumer files (templates, checklists, agent contracts) to align with governance changes. Both are necessary for complete alignment.
