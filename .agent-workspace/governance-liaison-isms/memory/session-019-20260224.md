- Session ID: session-019-20260224
- Contract Version: 3.0.0

## Task
GitHub Issue: Extract and report layer-down and implementation status of all mandatory platform-wide governance standards in this repo (AI, watchdog/oversight, tenant isolation, cross-app, QA/evidence requirements). Identify omissions or drift and initiate correction.

## What I Did

### Files Created
- `.agent-admin/build-evidence/PLATFORM_STANDARDS_LAYER_DOWN_STATUS_REPORT.md` — Comprehensive layer-down status report covering all requested governance standards
- `modules/mat/APP_STARTUP_REQUIREMENTS.md` — Remediation CG-001+CG-002: missing APP_STARTUP_REQUIREMENTS declaration for MAT module
- `.agent-admin/rca/README.md` — Remediation CG-004: pointer from standard RCA location to module-scoped RCA files

### Files Modified
- `modules/mat/02-architecture/security-architecture.md` — Remediation CG-003: added explicit citation of `maturion-tenant-isolation-standard.md` and `cross-tenant-intelligence-safety-layer-spec.md` in header table

### Actions Taken
1. Explored full repository structure (governance/canon/, Maturion/, modules/mat/, apps/, .agent-admin/)
2. Read CANON_INVENTORY.json to extract version and layer-down status of all key standards
3. Audited PLATFORM_AI_REQUIREMENTS.md, WATCHDOG_AUTHORITY_AND_SCOPE.md, WATCHDOG_QUALITY_INTEGRITY_CHANNEL.md, MANDATORY_CROSS_APP_COMPONENTS.md, EVIDENCE_ARTIFACT_BUNDLE_STANDARD.md, APP_STARTUP_REQUIREMENTS_DECLARATION.md presence and versions
4. Checked MAT module architecture docs, source files, and tests for implementation evidence
5. Generated comprehensive compliance report with 4 identified gaps
6. Created APP_STARTUP_REQUIREMENTS.md for MAT (resolves CG-001, CG-002)
7. Added tenant isolation citation in security-architecture.md (resolves CG-003)
8. Created .agent-admin/rca/README.md pointer (resolves CG-004)

### Decisions Made
- All four compliance gaps (CG-001 through CG-004) addressed in a single PR per issue request
- APP_STARTUP_REQUIREMENTS.md placed at `modules/mat/APP_STARTUP_REQUIREMENTS.md` per APP_STARTUP_REQUIREMENTS_DECLARATION.md §4.2 (application root/architecture directory)
- Watchdog service, tenant isolation (RLS), and evidence bundle confirmed as IMPLEMENTED — no runtime remediation required
- Platform-level three-watchdog system (Guardian/Sentinel/Arbiter) confirmed as platform concern, not individual module responsibility

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Ripple Status
- Ripple received: NO (issue-driven session)
- Sync state: ALIGNED as of 2026-02-24T11:44:12Z

### Governance Alignment
- Drift detected: NO
- Canon inventory version: 1.0.0
- Self-alignment executed: NO (already aligned)
- Alignment gate: PASSED

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE — Report created, all 4 compliance gaps remediated

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- CANON_INVENTORY.json enabled rapid extraction of version and layer-down status for all standards
- MAT module architecture was well-structured; governance standard references found in builder contract and FRS

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- APP_STARTUP_REQUIREMENTS.md was the one missing mandatory cross-app component for MAT
- The full three-watchdog AI autonomy system (Guardian/Sentinel/Arbiter) is a platform-level concern, not per-module
- MAT AI waves 7–9 are legitimately blocked on AIMC upstream dependency — this is architectural sequencing, not a compliance gap
