## Agent
- Type: governance-liaison-isms
- Class: liaison
- Session ID: governance-trs-upgrade-20260213
- Contract Version: 2.0.0

## Task
Governance Upgrade: Insert Technical Requirements Specification (TRS) step in module lifecycle and activate ripple to all repositories.

**Issue Context**: The ISMS project identified the need to formally introduce a TRS stage in the module lifecycle to prevent downstream implementation and integration failures due to missing technical constraints.

## What I Did

### Files Modified (3)

1. **governance/strategy/MODULE_LIFECYCLE_AND_REPO_STRUCTURE_STRATEGY.md** (SHA256: computed at commit)
   - Updated canonical module lifecycle from 6 to 7 stages
   - Inserted TRS stage (Stage 1.5) between FRS and Architecture
   - Added comprehensive Section 4.1 defining TRS:
     - Purpose: Bridge FRS (what) and Architecture (how)
     - Ownership: Architect or FM
     - Scope: 5 categories (technical constraints, performance, integration, traceability, tool validation)
     - Deliverables: TRS doc, FRS-to-TRS traceability matrix, validation rules
   - Updated module folder structure to include `01.5-trs/`
   - Updated success criteria to include TRS in lineage
   - Clarified TRS derivation chain: FRS → TRS → Architecture (per code review)

2. **governance/policy/APP_DESCRIPTION_REQUIREMENT_POLICY.md** (SHA256: computed at commit)
   - Updated canonical flow diagram: App Description → FRS → TRS → Architecture → Build Authorization → Implementation
   - Updated ordering rule to include TRS as mandatory stage

3. **RIPPLE_ACTIVATION_PLAN_TRS_UPGRADE.md** (SHA256: computed at commit)
   - Comprehensive ripple activation strategy (13,869 characters)
   - Documented automated vs manual ripple approaches
   - Identified missing ripple-listener workflow (requires implementation)
   - Governance change summary for upstream ripple
   - Consumer repo action items (office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster, FM)
   - Recommended HYBRID approach: manual for this cycle, automated for future

### Files Created (10)

4. **governance/templates/BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER_TEMPLATE.md** (SHA256: computed at commit)
   - New governance template for module lifecycle progress tracking
   - Includes all 7 stages with TRS stage (Stage 1.5)
   - Provides checklists for artifacts, approvals, completion dates
   - Governance compliance tracking
   - Template version: 1.0.0

5-12. **modules/[module]/BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md** (8 files - SHA256: computed at commit each)
   - Created for: course-crafter, incident-intelligence, isms, mat, maturity-roadmap, pit, risk-management, xdetect
   - Each tracker documents TRS stage as NOT_STARTED
   - Includes note explaining governance upgrade
   - Documents current module status (most at Stage 1-2, FRS/Architecture in progress)

### Actions Taken

1. **Phase 1: Analysis & Discovery**
   - Executed wake-up protocol manually (script DNE, verified CANON_INVENTORY intact)
   - Loaded 4 previous session memories
   - Verified governance alignment (sync_state.json: ALIGNED, 96/102 canons verified)
   - Identified module lifecycle governance files
   - Reviewed MODULE_LIFECYCLE_AND_REPO_STRUCTURE_STRATEGY.md (current: FRS → Architecture)
   - Reviewed REQUIREMENT_SPECIFICATION_GOVERNANCE.md and APP_DESCRIPTION_REQUIREMENT_POLICY.md
   - Created comprehensive execution plan

2. **Phase 2: Governance Document Updates**
   - Updated MODULE_LIFECYCLE_AND_REPO_STRUCTURE_STRATEGY.md with TRS stage
   - Defined TRS ownership, scope (5 categories), deliverables
   - Updated module directory structure (`01.5-trs/` folder)
   - Documented TRS-to-FRS and TRS-to-Architecture traceability
   - Added Section 4.1 explaining TRS purpose and relationships
   - Updated success criteria to include TRS
   - Updated APP_DESCRIPTION_REQUIREMENT_POLICY.md flow diagram

3. **Phase 3: Module Template Updates**
   - Created BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER_TEMPLATE.md with all 7 stages
   - Included TRS stage with status tracking, artifact checklist
   - Added governance compliance section

4. **Phase 4: Existing Module Updates**
   - Identified 8 existing modules
   - Created BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md for each module using bash script
   - Documented TRS stage as NOT_STARTED
   - Noted governance upgrade in each tracker

5. **Phase 5: Ripple Preparation**
   - Checked for ripple listener workflow (NOT FOUND)
   - Created comprehensive RIPPLE_ACTIVATION_PLAN_TRS_UPGRADE.md
   - Documented automated vs manual ripple options
   - Recommended HYBRID approach (manual this cycle, automated future)
   - Identified consumer repos: office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster, maturion-foreman-office-app
   - Prepared governance change summary and action items

6. **Phase 6: Validation & Evidence**
   - Validated governance syntax (markdown, cross-references manually)
   - Ran code_review on all changes (2 comments received and addressed)
   - Clarified TRS derivation chain per review feedback
   - Ran codeql_checker (no code changes detected - documentation only)

### Decisions Made

1. **Decision: Use `01.5-trs/` folder naming convention**
   - **Rationale**: Maintains chronological ordering between FRS (01) and Architecture (02)
   - **Impact**: Clear visual indication of stage sequence
   - **Authority**: MODULE_LIFECYCLE_AND_REPO_STRUCTURE_STRATEGY.md determinism principle

2. **Decision: TRS ownership = Architect or FM**
   - **Rationale**: TRS requires technical architecture expertise to define constraints
   - **Impact**: Clear accountability for TRS stage
   - **Authority**: FOREMAN_AUTHORITY_AND_SUPERVISION_MODEL.md

3. **Decision: Create BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER template and instances**
   - **Rationale**: Issue specifically requested BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md in each module
   - **Impact**: Visibility into module lifecycle progress, TRS stage status tracking
   - **Authority**: Issue requirements, MODULE_LIFECYCLE_AND_REPO_STRUCTURE_STRATEGY.md

4. **Decision: Recommend HYBRID ripple approach (manual now, automated later)**
   - **Rationale**: TRS upgrade time-sensitive; ripple-listener implementation should not block
   - **Impact**: Manual ripple for this cycle, automated for future
   - **Authority**: CROSS_REPO_RIPPLE_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL.md, pragmatic delivery

5. **Decision: Document ripple-listener absence explicitly**
   - **Rationale**: Issue called out missing workflow; must be transparent
   - **Impact**: Creates clear action item for future implementation
   - **Authority**: Agent contract - honesty and transparency obligation

6. **Decision: Clarify TRS derivation chain (FRS → TRS → Architecture)**
   - **Rationale**: Code review feedback - prevent confusion about derivation sequence
   - **Impact**: Clearer governance, prevents bypassing FRS
   - **Authority**: Code review feedback, governance clarity principle

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Systematic phase-by-phase execution**: Clear plan → execution → validation flow
2. **Bash scripting for repetitive tasks**: Created 8 BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md files efficiently
3. **Comprehensive ripple documentation**: RIPPLE_ACTIVATION_PLAN_TRS_UPGRADE.md provides clear path forward
4. **Code review integration**: Feedback improved clarity (derivation chain)
5. **Transparent gap documentation**: Ripple-listener absence documented clearly

### What Was Challenging
1. **Unicode characters in files**: Arrows in MODULE_LIFECYCLE_AND_REPO_STRUCTURE_STRATEGY.md required sed instead of edit tool
2. **Ripple-listener workflow absence**: Had to pivot from automated to hybrid approach
3. **Cross-repository dependencies**: Ripple affects multiple repos (office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster, FM)
4. **Determining TRS folder naming**: Chose `01.5-trs/` to maintain chronological ordering

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **TRS stage now mandatory**: All new modules must include TRS stage between FRS and Architecture
2. **TRS ownership**: Architect or FM responsible for TRS
3. **TRS scope**: 5 categories - technical constraints, performance, integration, traceability, tool validation
4. **BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER template exists**: Use `governance/templates/BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER_TEMPLATE.md`
5. **Ripple-listener workflow missing**: Needs implementation per CROSS_REPO_RIPPLE_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL.md
6. **Ripple activation plan documented**: Use RIPPLE_ACTIVATION_PLAN_TRS_UPGRADE.md as guide

### Governance Insights
1. **TRS prevents downstream failures**: Technical constraints captured early prevent implementation/integration issues
2. **Module lifecycle needed this gap filled**: FRS → Architecture jump was too large
3. **Ripple automation critical**: Manual ripple doesn't scale; automated ripple-listener needed
4. **Progress tracking valuable**: BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER provides visibility into module status
5. **Governance must adapt**: TRS insertion shows governance can evolve without breaking existing work
6. **Documentation-only changes are governance changes**: Even without code, governance updates have ripple impact

## Escalations and Follow-Up

### Escalation: Ripple-Listener Workflow Missing
**Type**: GOVERNANCE_GAP  
**Description**: No ripple-listener workflow exists in maturion-isms repository  
**Required By**: CROSS_REPO_RIPPLE_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL.md  
**Impact**: Manual ripple required, not scalable  
**Recommendation**: Implement `.github/workflows/ripple-listener.yml`  
**Authority**: CS2 or FM  
**Timeline**: Next sprint  
**Documented In**: RIPPLE_ACTIVATION_PLAN_TRS_UPGRADE.md Section 3

### Follow-Up Action: Manual Ripple Activation
**Action**: Create layer-down issues in consumer repos  
**Repos**: office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster, maturion-foreman-office-app  
**Timeline**: After PR merge  
**Assigned To**: Governance liaison agents in each repo  
**Documentation**: RIPPLE_ACTIVATION_PLAN_TRS_UPGRADE.md Section 4

### Follow-Up Action: Implement Automated Ripple
**Action**: Create ripple-listener.yml workflow  
**Priority**: HIGH (governance infrastructure)  
**Timeline**: Next sprint  
**Assigned To**: Governance Administrator or FM  
**Documentation**: RIPPLE_ACTIVATION_PLAN_TRS_UPGRADE.md Section 4.3
