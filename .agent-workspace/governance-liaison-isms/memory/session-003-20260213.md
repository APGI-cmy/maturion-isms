# Session 003 - 20260213 (Living Agent System v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: governance-liaison-isms
- Class: liaison
- Session ID: session-003-20260213

## Task
Standardize all existing ISMS module artifacts into canonical `modules/<module-slug>/` structure with manifests, legacy pointers, and migration map (governance/artifact-only).

## What I Did
### Files Modified
- Added canonical module trees under `modules/` for: pit, risk-management, mat, xdetect, incident-intelligence, course-crafter, isms, maturity-roadmap
- Added `module.manifest.json` per module
- Added legacy pointer files under `Maturion/*` old locations
- Added migration log: `modules/MODULE_MIGRATION_MAP.md`
- Added escalation: `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/escalation-inbox/blocker-20260213-missing-protocol-scripts.md`

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Attempted wake-up protocol script execution; script missing.
- Action 2: Ran baseline repository build/test scripts (both placeholder-pass).
- Action 3: Inventoried all legacy module artifacts in `Maturion/` and mapped to canonical module slugs.
- Action 4: Created canonical stage skeletons and copied module artifacts into stage-aligned locations.
- Action 5: Preserved legacy artifacts non-destructively under `90-legacy-assets/`.
- Action 6: Added old-location pointer files and module manifests.
- Action 7: Validated required stage directory presence and manifest existence for each module.
- Action 8: Attempted session closure protocol script execution; script missing.

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Use copy-based migration (not move/delete) to satisfy non-destructive governance requirement.
- Decision 2: Include `90-legacy-assets/original/` snapshots to preserve complete lineage and traceability.
- Decision 3: Create escalation document for missing mandatory governance scripts.

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: `modules/MODULE_MIGRATION_MAP.md`
- Status: Canonical structures and pointers created; legacy content retained.

### Ripple Status
- Status: No inbound ripple processing performed in this session.
- Ripple required: NO

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Gap documented for missing wake-up/session-closure scripts.

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Canonical module layout now standardized for current module set.

### Governance Alignment
- Local TIER_0 Canon: unchanged
- Canonical TIER_0 Canon: unchanged
- Drift: NONE detected for files touched in this issue scope
- Files aligned: module artifact tree standardized

## Outcome
⚠️ PARTIAL

## Lessons
### What Worked Well
- Canonical stage structure can be applied consistently using deterministic module slug mapping.

### What Was Challenging
- Mandatory governance protocol shell scripts referenced by contract are absent in repository.

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Re-run wake-up/session-closure via scripts once `.github/scripts/*protocol*.sh` is restored.

### Governance Insights
- Non-destructive dual-path preservation (`modules/*` + legacy pointers) supports auditability and phased human review.
