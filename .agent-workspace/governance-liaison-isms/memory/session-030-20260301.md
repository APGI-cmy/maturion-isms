## IAA Invocation Result

PHASE_A_ADVISORY — IAA not yet deployed. Proceeding under advisory mode. This PR is flagged for IAA review once Phase B activates.

---

## Merge Gate Parity Check

- governance/alignment: PASS (governance artifact only, no canonical files modified)
- No CI build checks applicable to markdown governance documents

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. §12 Acceptance Criteria AC-12 currently reads "PENDING CS2 REVIEW" — this should be updated in a follow-up to mark it as complete given CP-5 is now done. The task instructions said not to change §12, so this is deferred.
2. §3.1.2 response body shows `arc_request_id` as a non-null value in the `202 Accepted` example; under AMC Option C this will be null initially. A follow-up amendment to §3 should update the example response to show `arc_request_id: null` with a note about async population.
3. §8 Approval Workflow diagram still shows direct "ARC GitHub issue created (auto-trigger)" at step [3]; under AMC Option C, this step should reflect the AMC queue. A follow-up amendment to §8 is recommended.
