## Task Summary

Produced three governance document deliverables for LKIAC Wave CL-3-D2 (Gap Resolution). All
decisions frozen by foreman-v2-agent v6.2.0 (session-079) under CS2-delegated POLC planning
authority. Documentation-only — zero code changes.

---

## Roles Invoked

- governance-liaison-isms-agent: sole producer of all three deliverables
- foreman-v2-agent (delegating): provided frozen planning decisions
- No builder agents invoked (documentation-only wave)

## Actions Taken

1. Called `agent_bootstrap` as the absolute first action (GOV-BREACH-AIMC-W5-002 prevention)
2. Read existing governance documents: LKIAC_DEPRECATION_REGISTER.md, AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md
3. Created LKIAC_CL3_D2_GAP_RESOLUTION.md v1.0.0 — full gap resolution record for all 4 gap items
4. Updated LKIAC_DEPRECATION_REGISTER.md: DEP-005–008 rows, §4 Gap Register (RESOLVED status), §4.1 summary, §6 CP-3 checklist, §8 audit trail, version bump v1.1.0
5. Updated AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md: added Wave CL-3.5, extended CL-13 scope, added DEP-GAP rows to §8, added CP-3.5 to §10, updated dependency graph, version bump v1.2.0
6. Committed all changes in 2 commits
7. Code review: 1 comment — added Phase 1 bootstrap confirmation to document metadata
8. CodeQL: no findings (documentation-only)

## Key Decisions Recorded (Frozen — Foreman Authority)

| Gap ID | Resolution |
|--------|-----------|
| GAP-001 (DEP-005) | CL-13 extended scope — Foreman Office App QA Overview panel |
| GAP-002 (DEP-006) | CL-13 extended scope — Foreman Office App Unified QA Signal Aggregation view |
| GAP-003 (DEP-007) | CL-13 extended scope — Foreman Office App health module test results sub-view |
| GAP-004 (DEP-008) | New wave CL-3.5 — AIMC data source registry (ai_data_sources + 4 Edge Functions + admin UI) |

---

## Escalations Triggered

None. All work within governance liaison authority boundary. No constitutional changes, no
canonical governance modifications, no builder decisions made.

---

## IAA Invocation Result

IAA not yet deployed (Phase A). Logging invocation attempt. Proceeding under advisory mode.  
IAA phase status: PHASE_A_ADVISORY. This PR is flagged for IAA review once Phase B activates.

## CP-3 Gate Status

- Gap resolution decisions: RECORDED ✅
- GitHub issue creation for follow-on engineering work: PENDING CS2/human action ⏳
- CP-3 sign-off: PENDING CS2 ⏳

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **CL-3.5 schema specification prerequisite**: Before schema-builder begins CL-3.5-D2, consider
   producing a lightweight data model spec document (similar to how CL-5 has a spec wave before
   CL-11 implementation). A CL-3.5-spec sub-deliverable would make the CP-3.5 checkpoint
   more actionable for CS2 review.

2. **GitHub issue creation tooling**: The liaison currently cannot open GitHub issues. If
   CL-3-D2 gap decisions are a recurring deliverable pattern, consider whether a dedicated
   "issue creation" step should be delegated to a builder agent or CS2 at each CP gate, rather
   than relying on human action. This could be formalised in the LKIAC-001 protocol.

3. **CL-13 extended scope formalisation**: The CL-13 deliverables table in the execution plan
   currently does not enumerate CL-3.5-D equivalent IDs (e.g., CL-13-D5, CL-13-D6, CL-13-D7)
   for the three new QA modules. A follow-on amendment adding these deliverable IDs would
   strengthen the CL-13 exit criteria specificity.

## Lessons Learned

- When updating a table with a new column (Gap Register §4), it is cleaner to reproduce the full
  updated table rather than attempting surgical in-line column additions, which can misalign
  Markdown tables.
- Phase 1 bootstrap confirmation should be visible in produced artifacts, not just in agent
  session flow. Code review correctly caught this.
