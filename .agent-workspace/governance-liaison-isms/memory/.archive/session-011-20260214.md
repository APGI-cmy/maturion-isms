## Task
**Issue**: Governance Authority Correction for Builder Agent File Compliance Checklist

**Objective**: Correct authority boundary violation from Session 010 where governance requirements were created directly in consumer repo without canonical approval. Convert to draft proposal pending CS2 approval.

**Context**: 
- Session 010 created BUILDER_AGENT_FILE_COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md v2.0.0 with 77 requirements
- File placed in governance/artifacts/ as if canonical governance
- Marked as "Canonical Governance Artifact" with authority from "Maturion Engineering Leadership"
- PR reviewer identified governance authority chain violation
- Correct process: Governance Liaison → CS2 → Canonical Creation → Ripple → Layer Down
- Actual process: Governance Liaison → Codex Agent → Direct Creation in Consumer Repo

   - Files renamed: 1 (checklist moved to proposals/)
   - Files deleted: 1 (original checklist location)
   - Branch: copilot/complete-builder-agent-checklist

### Decisions Made

1. **Follow Path B (Proposal-First)**
   - **What**: Convert to draft proposal for faster resolution
   - **Why**: Preserves technical work while fixing governance process
   - **Authority**: REQ-AS-002 (CS2 Escalation Required), governance authority chain

2. **Clear Warning Strategy**
   - **What**: Add ⚠️ warnings throughout document
   - **Why**: Prevent misuse as canonical governance before CS2 approval
   - **Impact**: Every reader will see DRAFT PROPOSAL warnings

3. **Comprehensive Escalation**
   - **What**: Create detailed escalation document for CS2
   - **Why**: CS2 needs complete context to review and decide
   - **Content**: Authority violation analysis, corrective actions, two clear options

4. **Proposals Directory Creation**
   - **What**: Create dedicated directory for draft proposals
   - **Why**: Separates proposals from canonical governance
   - **Future**: Can hold other draft proposals pending approval

5. **Preserve Technical Content**
   - **What**: Keep all 77 requirements intact
   - **Why**: Technical work is valuable, only governance process needs correction
   - **Next**: CS2 can approve as-is or provide feedback for revision

## Lessons

### What Worked Well

1. **Authority Boundary Recognition**
   - Quickly recognized governance authority violation from PR feedback
   - Understood correct governance authority chain
   - Took immediate corrective action
   - Documented violation clearly for CS2 review

2. **Path B (Proposal-First) Selection**
   - Preserves valuable technical work (77 requirements)
   - Fixes governance process without discarding content
   - Provides CS2 with complete draft to review
   - Allows faster merge while maintaining governance integrity

3. **Clear Warning Strategy**
   - Multiple ⚠️ warnings throughout document
   - "DRAFT PROPOSAL" visible in title, header, footer
   - Clear instructions: "DO NOT USE UNTIL CS2 APPROVES"
   - Prevents accidental use as canonical governance

4. **Comprehensive Escalation**
   - Detailed authority violation analysis
   - Clear corrective actions taken
   - Two clear options for CS2 (approve or reject)
   - Complete context for CS2 decision

5. **Documentation**
   - Created proposals README explaining governance process
   - Session memory documents lessons learned
   - Escalation document provides full context
   - PR description clarifies proposal status

### What Was Challenging

1. **Recognizing Initial Mistake**
   - Session 010 felt complete at the time
   - Didn't initially recognize authority boundary issue
   - Required external PR feedback to identify problem
   - Lesson: Always question "Is this creating new governance?"

2. **Balancing Speed vs. Governance**
   - Wanted to deliver complete checklist quickly
   - Fast delivery led to governance shortcut
   - Correct process (CS2 approval) takes longer but maintains integrity
   - Lesson: Governance process cannot be rushed

3. **Understanding Codex Agent Escalation**
   - Correctly escalated to Codex Agent for drafting
   - But incorrectly treated result as canonical
   - Codex Agent produces drafts, not canonical governance
   - Lesson: All Codex Agent output should be marked DRAFT/PROPOSAL

4. **Multiple Warning Locations**
   - Had to update header, summary, usage, version history, footer
   - Many places to ensure DRAFT status is clear
   - Risk of missing a location
   - Solution: Systematic review of entire document

### What Future Sessions Should Know

1. **Governance Authority Chain (Critical)**
   - **Correct**: Governance Liaison → CS2 → Canonical Creation → Ripple → Layer Down
   - **Never**: Governance Liaison → Direct Creation in Consumer Repo
   - **Always**: Mark as DRAFT PROPOSAL until CS2 approves

2. **When Creating New Governance**
   - Check if canonical version exists (maturion-foreman-governance)
   - If not exists: Escalate to CS2 with draft proposal
   - Place draft in docs/proposals/ (never in governance/)
   - Add clear DRAFT PROPOSAL warnings
   - Create escalation document for CS2
   - Wait for canonical version before claiming authoritative

3. **Codex Agent Outputs**
   - Codex Agent produces drafts and proposals
   - Codex Agent does NOT have authority to create canonical governance
   - All Codex Agent output must be marked DRAFT/PROPOSAL
   - Requires CS2 review and approval before becoming canonical

4. **Proposals Directory**
   - Path: docs/proposals/
   - Purpose: Hold draft proposals pending CS2 approval
   - Naming: Use _DRAFT suffix for clarity
   - README: Explains governance process and current proposals

5. **Escalation Documents**
   - Path: .agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/escalation-inbox/
   - Format: Type, Severity, Summary, Problem, Corrective Action, CS2 Options
   - Purpose: Provide CS2 with complete context for decision
   - Include: Authority references, recommendations, related artifacts

6. **Authority Boundaries (REQ-AS-001, REQ-AS-002)**
   - ✅ CAN: Layer down existing canon from maturion-foreman-governance
   - ✅ CAN: Update governance inventories
   - ✅ CAN: Self-align governance artifacts
   - ✅ CAN: Escalate to Codex Agent for drafting
   - ✅ CAN: Mark drafts as PROPOSALS
   - ❌ CANNOT: Create canonical governance in consumer repo
   - ❌ CANNOT: Interpret governance policy
   - ❌ CANNOT: Approve constitutional canon changes

### Governance Insights

1. **Governance Fork Prevention is Critical**
   - If consumer repos create "canonical" governance
   - And canonical source doesn't have it
   - Two versions can diverge over time
   - Single source of truth is foundational to governance integrity

2. **Process Exists for Reason**
   - Governance authority chain (CS2 → FM → Liaison) prevents chaos
   - CS2 review ensures consistency, correctness, completeness
   - Canonical creation in one place ensures single source of truth
   - Ripple ensures all consumers stay synchronized

3. **Speed vs. Integrity Trade-off**
   - Fast delivery (Session 010) created governance shortcut
   - Correct process (Session 011) takes longer but maintains integrity
   - Governance cannot be rushed without risking fork
   - Always choose integrity over speed

4. **Clear Warnings Prevent Misuse**
   - Multiple ⚠️ DRAFT PROPOSAL warnings throughout document
   - "DO NOT USE UNTIL CS2 APPROVES" instructions
   - Clear status: "DRAFT PROPOSAL - Pending CS2 Approval"
   - Prevents accidental enforcement before canonical approval

5. **Escalation is Not Failure**
   - Escalating to CS2 is correct process, not admission of error
   - CS2 has authority to approve governance changes
   - Governance Liaison role is to maintain alignment, not create governance
   - Proper escalation demonstrates understanding of authority boundaries

6. **Session 010 Was Not a Complete Failure**
   - Technical content is excellent (77 requirements, machine-checkable)
   - Escalation to Codex Agent was correct
   - Only governance process needed correction
   - Valuable work preserved, only status corrected
