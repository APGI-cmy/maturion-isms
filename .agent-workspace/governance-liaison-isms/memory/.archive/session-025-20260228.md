## Task
Execute liaison checklist for Layer-Down issue: `[Layer-Down] Propagate Governance Changes - 2026-02-28 (6644ee51)`. Canonical commit `6644ee51ce714d3a9331b28b74b3e05f1b7ee880`. No PUBLIC_API governance files changed in this push. Trigger: `Merge pull request -1244 from APGI-cmy-copilot-investigate-layer-down-workflow`. Automated CI (ripple-integration.yml) created draft PRs #683-686 citing agent contract drift (CS2-gated). Task: record ripple receipt, update sync_state.json, add ripple-log entry, update GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md, create session memory.
Author `governance/aimc/AIMC_PERSONA_LIFECYCLE.md` — the AIMC Persona Lifecycle governance document required by AAWP Wave 9.10 (Gap 5 remediation from `governance/AUDIT/WAVE9_AIMC_FUNCTIONALITY_AUDIT.md` §4.5).

**AAWP Reference**: Wave 9.10 — Persona Lifecycle: Missing Personas + Versioning + Governance Document
**CS2 Authorisation**: Wave 9.10 (AIMC Agent Assignment Wave Plan, lines 780-816)
**Agent Assignment**: `governance-liaison-isms-agent` — Authors `AIMC_PERSONA_LIFECYCLE.md`; confirms canon alignment

## What I Did

### Analysis

**No PUBLIC_API governance files changed** in canonical commit `6644ee51ce714d3a9331b28b74b3e05f1b7ee880`. This is a no-change ripple triggered by `Merge pull request -1244 from APGI-cmy-copilot-investigate-layer-down-workflow`. The automated CI workflow (ripple-integration.yml) ran 4 times and created DRAFT PRs #683-686 claiming agent contract drift requiring CS2 escalation.

**B-04 check**: Canonical commit `6644ee51` is NOT in ripple-log.json from prior sessions (last entry was `810218ff` from align-20260227-164918). This is a new dispatch. Proceeding with normal no-change ripple processing.

**Note on CI Draft PRs #683-686**: The automated workflow created these based on detected overall drift (comparing local repo against canonical source state). These are CS2-gated per AGCFPP-001 because agent contract files were detected in the drift. These PRs are separate from this no-change ripple processing and remain pending CS2 review. Liaison does not modify agent contract files (A-05, HALT-003).

### Liaison Checklist

#### 1. Verify files layered down match canonical inventory ✅
- No PUBLIC_API files changed in this ripple

### Actions Taken
- Executed Phase 1 preflight (all 7 steps)
- Confirmed B-04 not triggered (6644ee51 is new dispatch)
- Confirmed no PUBLIC_API files changed — no layer-down required
- Updated sync_state.json
- Added liaison-confirmation entry to ripple-log.json
- Created no-drift report
- Updated GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md
- Archived session-020 to memory/.archive/
- Created this session memory (session-025)

### Decisions Made
- No layer-down required: no PUBLIC_API governance files changed
- No CS2 escalation required from liaison side: no agent contract files modified in this ripple
- CI draft PRs #683-686 noted as separate CS2-gated items (agent contract drift) — not within liaison scope to action
- sync_state.json updated to record new canonical commit (6644ee51) even though no files changed — maintains accurate record of ripple processing

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Ripple Status
- Ripple received: YES (canonical commit 6644ee51, issue created 2026-02-28)
- No PUBLIC_API files: confirmed
- B-04 duplicate: NO — new dispatch
- Layer-down: NOT REQUIRED

### Alignment Status
- Overall: ALIGNED
- Canon files: 102 total, 96 aligned, 6 SHA256 variance (pre-existing), 0 missing
- Drift detected: false
- Last drift check: 2026-02-28T14:14:40Z

### PREHANDOVER_PROOF
- Not required: no executable artifacts modified in this session

## IAA Invocation (Phase 4.4)

IAA invoked for independent assurance verification.

> "Invoking IAA for independent assurance verification.
> Evidence artifacts: drift-report-session-025-20260228.md, this session memory, sync_state.json, ripple-log.json, GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md.
> IAA phase status: PHASE_A_ADVISORY. IAA not yet deployed in blocking mode for no-change ripple governance sessions. This session is flagged for IAA review once Phase B activates."

iaa_invocation_result: NOT_REQUIRED (no-change ripple, no executable artifacts modified, no agent contracts in scope)

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. The automated ripple-integration.yml workflow creates CS2-gated DRAFT PRs when agent contract drift is detected, even for no-change ripple events. Consider adding a gate to the workflow to distinguish between ripple-event-triggered drift and pre-existing local drift before creating agent-contract PRs.

2. The issue auto-close eligibility criteria require a "Ripple PR merged to main" — for no-change ripples where no files are updated, clarify whether a PR containing only sync record updates (sync_state.json, ripple-log.json) satisfies this requirement.

## Outcome Classification
✅ COMPLETE: All work finished, no blockers

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **PersonaLoader YAML validation enforcement**: The governance doc references that `PersonaLoader` should throw on missing required front-matter fields (§5.4). A future wave should verify this enforcement is implemented in `PersonaLoader.ts` and covered by a specific RED gate test — not just assumed to exist.

2. **Persona Registry automation**: The Persona Registry (§2 of `AIMC_PERSONA_LIFECYCLE.md`) is manually maintained. A future governance enhancement could add a CI check that validates the registry table is in sync with the actual persona files on disk (e.g., all files in `packages/ai-centre/src/agents/*.md` appear in the registry table).

3. **Quarterly review automation**: The quarterly review cadence (§4.1) relies on `governance-liaison-isms-agent` monitoring `last_reviewed` dates. A GitHub Actions scheduled workflow that flags overdue persona reviews would remove the dependency on agent memory.

## Outcome Classification

✅ COMPLETE — All Wave 9.10 governance liaison deliverables finished, no blockers.
