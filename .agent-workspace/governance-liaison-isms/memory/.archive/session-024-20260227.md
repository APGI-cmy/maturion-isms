## Task
Execute liaison checklist for Layer-Down issue: `[Layer-Down] Propagate Governance Changes - 2026-02-27 (fad4bc87)`. Canonical commit `fad4bc8786eb99ed75354aed50c0a50cdd8d055a`. No PUBLIC_API governance files changed in this push. Automated CI (ripple-integration.yml) already confirmed "No Drift Detected" x4. Task: record ripple receipt, update sync_state.json, add ripple-log entry, update GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md, create session memory.

## What I Did

### Analysis

**No PUBLIC_API governance files changed** in canonical commit `fad4bc8786eb99ed75354aed50c0a50cdd8d055a`. This was a no-change ripple triggered by a test pipeline merge (`trigger-governance-pipeline-test`). The automated CI workflow (ripple-integration.yml) ran 4 times and posted "No Drift Detected — Governance is already aligned with canonical source. No PR required."

**B-04 check**: Canonical commit `fad4bc87` is NOT in ripple-log.json from prior sessions. This is a new dispatch. Proceeding with normal no-change ripple processing.

### Liaison Checklist

#### 1. Verify files layered down match canonical inventory ✅
- No PUBLIC_API files changed in this ripple
- No layer-down required
- CANON_INVENTORY.json: version 1.0.0, 0 placeholder hashes — valid
- Existing canon files: all aligned per prior session-022 confirmation
- SHA256 variance files (6 files from session-022): unchanged, pre-existing variance

#### 2. Confirm no agent contract files modified ✅
- No `.github/agents/*.md` files in artifact list (issue confirms this)
- No CS2 escalation required

#### 3. Update sync records ✅
- `governance/sync_state.json`: updated `last_sync.canonical_commit` to `fad4bc8786eb99ed75354aed50c0a50cdd8d055a`, `last_sync.session_id` to `session-024-20260227`, `last_sync.timestamp` to `2026-02-27T16:28:34Z`, `last_sync.total_canons_synced` to 0, `last_sync.sync_method` to `no-change-ripple`
- `.agent-admin/governance/ripple-log.json`: liaison-confirmation entry added (session-024)
- `.agent-admin/governance/drift-report-session-024-20260227.md`: no-drift report created
- `GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md`: updated header and Last Sync entry

#### 4. Document completion ✅
- Session memory: this file (session-024-20260227.md)
- Ripple-log.json: liaison-confirmation entry added

### Files Modified
- `governance/sync_state.json` — updated canonical_commit to fad4bc87, session_id to session-024, total_canons_synced to 0, sync_method to no-change-ripple
- `.agent-admin/governance/ripple-log.json` — added liaison-confirmation entry (session-024, fad4bc87, no-change)
- `.agent-admin/governance/drift-report-session-024-20260227.md` — created (no drift, no changes)
- `GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md` — updated Last Updated, Layer-Down Session, Latest Canonical Commit, Last Sync

### Actions Taken
- Executed Phase 1 preflight (all 7 steps)
- Confirmed B-04 not triggered (fad4bc87 is new dispatch)
- Confirmed no PUBLIC_API files changed — no layer-down required
- Updated sync_state.json
- Added liaison-confirmation entry to ripple-log.json
- Created no-drift report
- Updated GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md
- Archived session-019 to memory/.archive/
- Created this session memory (session-024)

### Decisions Made
- No layer-down required: no PUBLIC_API governance files changed
- No CS2 escalation required: no agent contract files modified
- sync_state.json updated to record new canonical commit (fad4bc87) even though no files changed — this maintains an accurate record of ripple processing
- GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md updated with "Latest Canonical Commit" header field (new field, does not replace Latest Ripple PR since no new PR was needed)

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Ripple Status
- Ripple received: YES (ripple-received-20260227T124217Z.json exists)
- Ripple processed: COMPLETE (no-change ripple — no files to layer down)
- Files updated: 0 (no PUBLIC_API files changed)
- Governance documentation updated: sync_state.json, ripple-log.json, GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md, drift report

### Governance Alignment
- Drift detected: NO (automated CI x4 confirmed, sync_state drift_detected: false)
- Self-alignment executed: N/A (no drift)
- Alignment gate: PASSED

## Required Fields

- prior_sessions_reviewed: session-019-20260224, session-020-20260226, session-021-20260226, session-022-20260227, session-023-20260227
- unresolved_items_from_prior_sessions: none
- roles_invoked: governance-liaison-isms (self)
- governance_artifacts_aligned: none (no PUBLIC_API files changed)
- escalations_triggered: none
- iaa_invocation_result: NOT_REQUIRED (no agent contract files modified, no executable artifacts changed, governance documentation only)

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- B-04 check was clean: ripple-log.json clearly showed fad4bc87 had not been previously processed
- Automated CI confirmation (x4) aligned with manual analysis: no drift, no layer-down required
- Session-023 precedent for no-change ripple handling provided clear workflow template

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- When a ripple contains no PUBLIC_API file changes, the liaison still needs to: (1) update sync_state.json with the new canonical commit, (2) add a liaison-confirmation entry to ripple-log.json, (3) create a drift report, (4) update GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md. This maintains the audit trail even for "empty" ripples.
- The `layer-down-received` receipt for this ripple (`layer-down-received-20260227T124221Z.json`) contains the previous canonical commit `a925dd789b25f27f804b35df9019494371449aae` rather than `fad4bc87`. This appears to be a workflow artifact timing issue — the receipt was created by the automated workflow before the new commit was fully propagated. This is a pre-existing artifact state and should not be modified.

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY — this field may NEVER be blank)

The `layer-down-received` receipt auto-generated by `governance-ripple-sync.yml` should include the triggering ripple's canonical commit (from the repository_dispatch payload) rather than the previous canonical commit from sync_state.json. This would prevent the discrepancy observed in session-024 where `layer-down-received-20260227T124221Z.json` shows commit `a925dd789b25` instead of the triggering commit `fad4bc87`. Alternatively, the receipt could include both fields: `triggering_commit` and `prior_canonical_commit`.
