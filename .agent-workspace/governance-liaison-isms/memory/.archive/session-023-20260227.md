## Task
Execute liaison checklist for Layer-Down issue #648: `[Layer-Down] Governance ripple received — a925dd789b25`. Canonical commit `a925dd789b25f27f804b35df9019494371449aae`, 6 files layered down. **B-04 triggered**: this canonical commit was already fully processed in session-022 (issue #637, ripple PRs #639/#640/#641). Apply B-04 protocol: log duplicate in session memory, do not re-execute layer-down.

## What I Did

### B-04 Duplicate Detection Applied

**Rule B-04**: "Ripple dispatch-id already processed — I skip the event and log the duplicate in session memory. I do NOT re-execute layer-down for an already-processed dispatch-id."

**Evidence of prior processing (session-022)**:
- Canonical commit: `a925dd789b25f27f804b35df9019494371449aae` ✅
- Issue: #637 (`[Layer-Down] Governance alignment required — a925dd789b25`) ✅
- Ripple PRs auto-merged: #639, #640, #641 ✅
- Files verified: AUTOMATED_QUALITY_TOOLING_CANON.md, CODE_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD_CANON.md, CONTRACT_TESTING_CANON.md, POST_PRODUCTION_TELEMETRY_CANON.md, CANON_INVENTORY.json, sync_state.json ✅
- SHA256 verified: ✅
- AIMC integration confirmed: ✅
- Cross-references updated: ✅
- GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md updated: ✅
- ripple-log.json liaison-confirmation entry: session-022-20260227 ✅

**Current alignment state** (from sync_state.json):
- overall: ALIGNED
- canonical_commit: a925dd789b25f27f804b35df9019494371449aae
- drift_detected: false
- last_drift_check: 2026-02-27T10:46:44Z

**Conclusion**: Issue #648 is a duplicate dispatch for a canonical commit that is fully aligned and confirmed. No action required beyond B-04 logging.

### Liaison Checklist (Verified from session-022 completion)

#### 1. Verify files layered down match canonical inventory ✅ (confirmed via session-022)
- 6 files layered: 4 new canon files + CANON_INVENTORY.json + sync_state.json
- SHA256 verification: all 4 canon files matched CANON_INVENTORY.json
- No re-verification required per B-04

#### 2. Confirm AIMC canon is integrated and referenced where relevant ✅ (confirmed via session-022)
- CODE_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD_CANON.md: contains REQ-CCT-003 — AIMC Module higher coverage thresholds
- CONTRACT_TESTING_CANON.md: mandates contract tests for all AIMC integration points (REQ-CT-002)
- AIMC_STRATEGY.md: present and SHA256-verified

#### 3. Trigger internal ripple: update cross-references and linked artefacts ✅ (completed in session-022)
- Cross-references verified and updated in session-022
- GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md updated in session-022

#### 4. Document completion in session memory and evidence artefacts ✅
- Session memory: this file (session-023-20260227.md)
- ripple-log.json: B-04 liaison-duplicate-note entry added (session-023-20260227)

### Files Modified
- `.agent-admin/governance/ripple-log.json` — added B-04 liaison-duplicate-note entry for session-023/issue #648

### Actions Taken
- Executed Phase 1 preflight (all 7 steps)
- Detected B-04 duplicate: canonical commit a925dd789b25 already confirmed in session-022
- Applied B-04: skipped layer-down re-execution
- Added liaison-duplicate-note to ripple-log.json
- Archived session-018 to memory/.archive/
- Created this session memory (session-023)
- Appended to parking-station suggestions-log.md

### Decisions Made
- B-04 applied: no layer-down re-execution
- No sync_state.json update required (already ALIGNED, session-022 confirmed)
- No GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md update required (already reflects session-022 confirmation)

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Ripple Status
- Ripple received: YES (issue #648 dispatch)
- Ripple processed: B04_DUPLICATE — already processed in session-022 (issue #637)
- Layer-down skipped: YES (per B-04 rule)
- Prior confirmation: session-022-20260227 (ripple PRs #639/#640/#641)

### Governance Alignment
- Drift detected: NO (sync_state.json drift_detected: false)
- Self-alignment executed: N/A (B-04 duplicate, already aligned)
- Alignment gate: PASSED (confirmed from session-022)

### AIMC Integration
- AIMC_STRATEGY.md: present and SHA256-verified ✅ (confirmed session-022)
- Consumer references: governance/aimc/ (3 files) ✅

## Required Fields

- prior_sessions_reviewed: session-018-20260224, session-019-20260224, session-020-20260226, session-021-20260226, session-022-20260227
- unresolved_items_from_prior_sessions: none
- roles_invoked: governance-liaison-isms (self)
- governance_artifacts_aligned: none (B-04 duplicate — already aligned in session-022)
- escalations_triggered: none
- iaa_invocation_result: NOT_REQUIRED (governance documentation only, no agent contract files modified, B-04 duplicate)

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- B-04 duplicate detection worked as designed: session-022's ripple-log.json liaison-confirmation entry provided clear evidence that canonical commit a925dd789b25 was already processed
- sync_state.json drift_detected: false confirmed alignment was current

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Issue #648 was auto-generated by the ripple workflow after session-022 already confirmed the alignment for issue #637 (same canonical commit a925dd789b25). The automated workflow creating a new issue after a successful confirmation is likely a race condition or duplicate trigger in the issue-generation pipeline.
- When B-04 applies, the liaison must still document the duplicate in session memory and add a liaison-duplicate-note to ripple-log.json — this is the audit trail required by the FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry.

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY — this field may NEVER be blank)

The ripple workflow should implement an idempotency check before creating a new layer-down issue: if a liaison-confirmation entry already exists in ripple-log.json for the canonical commit being dispatched, suppress the issue creation (or create it with a B-04 flag to allow the liaison to close it immediately). This would prevent unnecessary duplicate sessions like session-023.
