   - Verified CANON_INVENTORY.json integrity
   - Confirmed governance alignment status

2. **Protocol Analysis**
   - Reviewed LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md v1.0.0 in detail
   - Identified Phase 1-5 process
   - Confirmed my role: Phase 1 (Detection & Documentation) ONLY
   - Confirmed governance-repo-administrator role: Phase 2-5 (Intake, Analysis, Integration, Ripple)
   - Identified authority boundary: cannot cross repository boundaries to modify canonical source

3. **Evidence Collection**
   - Retrieved PR #98 details (merged, commit 9017e4f)
   - Retrieved session 005 memory (TRS upgrade)
   - Calculated SHA256 checksums for 3 governance files:
     - MODULE_LIFECYCLE_AND_REPO_STRUCTURE_STRATEGY.md: `b832fc05e9dfdb3cc238b3750a2131598383d1d32edb2d7382f6483fab460773`
     - APP_DESCRIPTION_REQUIREMENT_POLICY.md: `3e14b061c313aab7b70197846b333f17b7de7db445b6feb9b9cf57afc88b422c`

   - Documented breaking change classification
   - Assessed impact (4 repos, HIGH priority)
   - Prepared ripple log format entries
   - Included full TRS stage definition in appendix
   - Included file diffs summary

5. **Authority Boundary Analysis**
   - Identified that Phase 2-5 requires cross-repository actions
   - Confirmed governance-liaison-isms cannot:
     - Create issues in other repositories (tool limitation)
     - Modify canonical governance repository (authority constraint)
     - Execute governance-repo-administrator responsibilities
   - Created escalation document for next steps
   - Identified 3 resolution paths for higher authority

6. **Progress Reporting**
   - Committed LAYER_UP_TRS_GOVERNANCE_UPGRADE.md
   - Updated PR description with phase completion status

### Decisions Made

1. **Decision: Follow LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL Phase 1 only**
   - **Rationale**: Authority boundary explicitly prevents cross-repository modifications
   - **Impact**: Layer-up Phase 1 complete; Phase 2-5 requires escalation
   - **Authority**: governance-liaison-isms contract v2.0.0, LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md Section 6

2. **Decision: Create comprehensive evidence package**
   - **Rationale**: Enable governance-repo-administrator to execute Phase 2-5 without additional investigation
   - **Impact**: All evidence, analysis, and proposals documented in single file
   - **Authority**: LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md Section 6, Phase 1, Step 1

3. **Decision: Escalate to CS2/governance-repo-administrator**
   - **Rationale**: Cannot create issues in maturion-foreman-governance repository
   - **Impact**: Human or governance-repo-administrator must initiate Phase 2
   - **Authority**: REQ-AS-002 (Escalation Protocol), authority boundary compliance

4. **Decision: Use HIGH priority classification**
   - **Rationale**: Governance enhancement validated; prevents implementation failures; moderate breaking change; affects 4 repos
   - **Impact**: Signals urgency for governance-repo-administrator intake
   - **Authority**: LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md Section 6, Phase 2

5. **Decision: Document 3 resolution paths**
   - **Rationale**: Provide flexibility for higher authority to choose appropriate path
   - **Impact**: Human can create issue manually, governance-repo-administrator can monitor, or direct PR possible
   - **Authority**: Escalation best practices, operational flexibility

## Living Agent System Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: LAYER_UP_TRS_GOVERNANCE_UPGRADE.md (comprehensive)
- Status: Phase 1 complete; Phase 2-5 escalated

### Ripple Status
- Status: LAYER_UP Phase 1 complete; awaiting governance-repo-administrator
- Ripple required: YES (4 consumer repos after canonical integration)
- Ripple mechanism: governance-ripple-dispatch.yml in maturion-foreman-governance → consumer repos

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Layer-up request documented; gap closure requires canonical integration
- Gap: TRS governance local to maturion-isms; needs propagation to canonical governance
- Next: governance-repo-administrator executes Phase 2-5

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: ✅ CLEAN - all documentation consistent and complete
- Cross-references validated
- Authority boundaries respected

### Governance Alignment
- Local TIER_0 Canon: Current (no drift)
- Canonical TIER_0 Canon: Current
- Drift: ✅ NONE
- Files aligned: N/A (layer-up action, not layer-down)

## Outcome
⚠️ PARTIAL

**Completed**:
- ✅ Phase 1 of LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL (Detection & Documentation)
- ✅ Comprehensive evidence package created
- ✅ Impact assessment and breaking change analysis
- ✅ Authority boundary respected
- ✅ Escalation created for next steps

**Pending** (requires higher authority):
- ⏳ Phase 2: Intake & Validation (governance-repo-administrator)
- ⏳ Phase 3: Analysis & Proposal (governance-repo-administrator)
- ⏳ Phase 4: Review & Integration (CS2 approval, merge to canonical)
- ⏳ Phase 5: Ripple Back (layer-down to consumer repos)

**Escalation Created**: `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/escalation-inbox/layer-up-trs-next-steps-20260213.md`

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL provided clear guidance**: Explicit phase-by-phase process made authority boundaries clear
2. **Evidence package preparation**: All necessary information consolidated in single file for downstream consumption
3. **Authority boundary compliance**: Respected constraints; did not attempt unauthorized cross-repository actions
4. **Comprehensive documentation**: 18,780 character layer-up request covers all protocol requirements
5. **Multiple resolution paths**: Provided flexibility for higher authority

### What Was Challenging
1. **Issue description ambiguity**: Issue described end-to-end outcome but my role is Phase 1 only
2. **Tool limitations**: Cannot create issues in other repositories programmatically
3. **Authority boundary interpretation**: Required careful reading of LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL to understand scope
4. **Cross-repository complexity**: Layer-up requires coordination across multiple repositories and agents

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **Layer-up is multi-phase**: governance-liaison executes Phase 1 only; governance-repo-administrator handles Phase 2-5
2. **Evidence package is key**: Comprehensive documentation enables downstream phases without additional investigation
3. **Authority boundaries are strict**: Cannot cross repository boundaries even for governance escalation
4. **Tool limitations exist**: Issue creation in other repos requires human or higher-authority agent
5. **LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL is authoritative**: Follow protocol exactly; don't skip phases or attempt unauthorized actions
6. **Escalation is appropriate**: When authority boundary reached, escalate with clear next steps

### Governance Insights
1. **Layer-up protocol works**: Structured Phase 1-5 process prevents unauthorized governance changes
2. **Authority separation enforced**: governance-liaison cannot modify canonical governance; governance-repo-administrator required
3. **Evidence-based evolution**: Layer-up requires validated evidence; speculative changes prohibited
4. **Bidirectional ripple tracking**: Layer-up → canon change → layer-down creates complete governance loop
5. **Cross-repository governance coordination complex**: Requires multiple agents, multiple repositories, human approval
6. **Issue-based escalation is correct pattern**: Prevents unauthorized direct modifications to canonical governance

## Escalations and Follow-Up

### Escalation: Layer-Up Next Steps Beyond Authority
**Type**: AUTHORITY_BOUNDARY  
**Description**: TRS governance layer-up Phase 1 complete; Phase 2-5 requires cross-repository actions beyond governance-liaison authority  
**Required By**: LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md Section 6, Phase 2-5  
**Impact**: TRS governance remains local until canonical integration  
**Recommendation**: CS2/Johan or governance-repo-administrator execute Phase 2-5  
**Authority**: CS2 or governance-repo-administrator  
**Timeline**: HIGH priority - governance enhancement validated  
**Documented In**: `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/escalation-inbox/layer-up-trs-next-steps-20260213.md`

### Follow-Up Action: Create Issue in maturion-foreman-governance
**Action**: Create layer-up issue in APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance  
**Content**: Use LAYER_UP_TRS_GOVERNANCE_UPGRADE.md from maturion-isms  
**Labels**: layer-up, governance-improvement  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Timeline**: As soon as possible  
**Assigned To**: CS2/Johan or governance-repo-administrator  
**Documentation**: LAYER_UP_TRS_GOVERNANCE_UPGRADE.md in maturion-isms

### Follow-Up Action: Governance-Repo-Administrator Phase 2-5
**Action**: Execute LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL Phase 2-5 (Intake, Analysis, Integration, Ripple)  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Timeline**: After issue created in maturion-foreman-governance  
**Assigned To**: governance-repo-administrator  
**Documentation**: LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md Section 6

### Follow-Up Action: Ripple Dispatch to Consumer Repos
**Action**: After canonical merge, dispatch governance_ripple to 4 consumer repos  
**Repos**: maturion-isms, maturion-foreman-office-app, PartPulse, R_Roster  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Timeline**: Immediately after canonical governance PR merge  
**Assigned To**: governance-ripple-dispatch.yml workflow + governance-liaison agents in consumer repos  
**Documentation**: CROSS_REPO_RIPPLE_TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL.md
