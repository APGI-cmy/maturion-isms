## Changes Summary

**Change 1 — YAML metadata**: contract_version 3.0.0→3.1.0; tier2_knowledge.required_files +scripts.md +session-memory-template.md; last_updated 2026-02-25 confirmed correct.

**Change 2 — Phase 1 replacement**: Replaced disordered steps (1.1→1.4→1.2→1.3) with canonical 1.1→1.2→1.3→1.4→1.5→1.6→1.7 structure with full ⛔ DO NOT ADVANCE guards.

**Change 3 — Tier 2 refactor of Phase 3 scripts**: Removed inline bash blocks from 3.1 (SHA256 validation + sync state JSON), 3.2 (ripple inbox creation + sync state update + archive), and 3.3 (drift detection script). Replaced each set with a Tier 2 reference line to scripts.md.

**Change 4 — Phase 3.8**: Added merge gate parity check section (mandatory before Phase 4).

**Change 5 — Phase 4 OPOJD gate**: Added new section 4.1 (OPOJD Gate) before evidence bundle. Renumbered: Session Memory 4.1→4.3, IAA 4.3a→4.4a, Escalation 4.3→4.4. Reordered sections in file to maintain numerical order (4.1→4.2→4.3→4.4a→4.4).

**Change 6 — Phase 4.3 Session Memory update**: Replaced inline template (~1,200 chars) with Tier 2 reference to session-memory-template.md. Added Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY) note. Updated parking station format to fleet-standard with [ALIGNMENT/SESSION-END] phase tag.

**Change 7 — scripts.md created**: All extracted bash/JSON scripts organized in named sections: SHA256 Validation, Sync State Update, Ripple Inbox Creation, Ripple Archive, Drift Detection.

**Change 8 — session-memory-template.md created**: Fleet-standard template with session memory template and PREHANDOVER proof template adapted for governance-liaison-isms.

**Change 9 — index.md updated**: Knowledge version 1.0.0→1.1.0, Contract version 3.0.0→3.1.0, Last Updated 2026-02-25, scripts.md and session-memory-template.md added to table.

**Change 10 — session memory + PREHANDOVER proof**: This file + PREHANDOVER-session-020-20260225.md created.

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

Session-020 improvement observations:
1. **Phase 4 section reordering**: The task required physical reordering of Phase 4 sections (4.2 Evidence Bundle to immediately follow 4.1 OPOJD gate, before 4.3 Session Memory). Future contract updates should specify both the new numbering AND the desired physical section order to avoid ambiguity.
2. **Inline template extraction to Tier 2**: The inline session memory template (~1,200 chars) was extracted to Tier 2 as part of this wave to stay within the 30,000 char limit. This is architecturally correct per Three-Tier Architecture but was not explicitly listed in the task changes — the size constraint made it necessary. Recommend making this a standard pattern for all agents: large inline templates → Tier 2.
3. **Size budget tracking**: The contract was 29,117 chars before changes. Adding Phase 1 (6,890 chars), Phase 3.8 (900 chars), and Phase 4.1 OPOJD (600 chars) while removing bash scripts (~700 chars) created a temporary exceedance of 31,257 chars. The checklist compression and inline template extraction restored compliance. A pre-change size budget calculation would prevent this iterative approach.
