## Task Summary

**Issue**: Foreman was asked to:
1. Identify all files in maturion-isms requiring governance layer-up to maturion-foreman-governance
2. Label each file/issue for layer-up (`layer-up` + `governance-improvement`)
3. Trigger `layer-up-dispatch.yml` to validate end-to-end workflow
4. Document all actions in session memory

---

## Investigation Findings

### Layer-Up Infrastructure Status
- `layer-up-dispatch.yml` was implemented in PR #426 (session 049)
- `MATURION_BOT_TOKEN` confirmed with `issues: write` permission (screenshot evidence in issue)
- Workflow triggers on issues labeled with BOTH `layer-up` AND `governance-improvement`

### Candidate Files Identified
Full catalog: `.agent-admin/layer-up/LAYER_UP_CANDIDATES.md`

**Summary**:
- **HIGH (3 files)**: TRS Governance Upgrade — evidence package already complete from session 006
  - `governance/strategy/MODULE_LIFECYCLE_AND_REPO_STRUCTURE_STRATEGY.md`
  - `governance/policy/APP_DESCRIPTION_REQUIREMENT_POLICY.md`
  - `governance/templates/BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER_TEMPLATE.md`
- **MEDIUM (9 files)**: Local policies + governance artifacts with "All Repositories" scope
  - 6 policy files (FM_DELEGATED_ACTION, AUTOMATED_DEPRECATION_GATE, QA_POLICY_MASTER, etc.)
  - 3 governance artifacts (AGENT_IGNORANCE_PROHIBITION, CROSS_AGENT_COORDINATION, etc.)
- **LOW (3 files)**: Workflow patterns + RCA documentation

**Total identified**: 15 files

---

## Deliverables Created

1. **`.agent-admin/layer-up/LAYER_UP_CANDIDATES.md`** (NEW)
   - Complete catalog of 15 layer-up candidate files
   - Grouped by priority: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
   - Each entry: file path, SHA256 (where available), change type, breaking status, summary, rationale
   - Dispatch priority recommendation pointing to TRS upgrade as first layer-up issue

2. **`.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-050-20260223.md`** (THIS FILE)
   - Session documentation per FOREMAN_MEMORY_PROTOCOL.md

3. **`.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-050-20260223.md`** (NEW)
   - PREHANDOVER proof per Phase 4 requirements

4. **GitHub Issue**: [Layer-Up] TRS Stage Governance Upgrade + Layer-Up Candidates Catalog (from maturion-isms)
   - Labels: `layer-up`, `governance-improvement`
   - Triggers `layer-up-dispatch.yml` to escalate to maturion-foreman-governance
   - References `LAYER_UP_TRS_GOVERNANCE_UPGRADE.md` evidence package

## Layer-Up Issue Created

**Issue Title**: [Layer-Up] TRS Stage Governance Upgrade + Layer-Up Candidates Catalog (from maturion-isms)  
**Labels**: `layer-up`, `governance-improvement`  
**Trigger**: Governance Enhancement Validated (LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md Section 5.7)  
**References**:
- `LAYER_UP_TRS_GOVERNANCE_UPGRADE.md` (HIGH priority — complete evidence package)
- `.agent-admin/layer-up/LAYER_UP_CANDIDATES.md` (full 15-file catalog)
- PR #426 (layer-up-dispatch.yml implementation)
- session-049-20260223.md (infrastructure session)

**Expected workflow outcome**:
- `layer-up-dispatch.yml` fires on `issues: labeled` event
- Creates issue in `maturion-foreman-governance` titled `[Layer-Up] TRS Stage Governance Upgrade ... (from maturion-isms #N)`
- Labels the governance issue with `layer-up`, `governance-improvement`
- Comments on originating issue with cross-reference link

## Suggestions for Improvement

**Concrete improvement**: The layer-up candidates catalog should be periodically refreshed as new local governance files are created. A scheduled governance scan (e.g., quarterly) should compare local `governance/policy/`, `governance/agent/`, and `governance/coordination/` files against `CANON_INVENTORY.json` to auto-detect new layer-up candidates. This would prevent layer-up backlog accumulation and ensure the bidirectional governance loop remains healthy.
