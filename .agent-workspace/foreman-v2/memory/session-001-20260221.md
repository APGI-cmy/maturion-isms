# Session 001 - 20260221 (LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: foreman-v2
- Class: foreman (supervisor)
- Session ID: session-001-20260221
- Contract Version: 2.1.0

## Task
Harden the Foreman-v2 agent contract to the canonical 2026 Living Agent System standard:
- Full mode-aware orchestration (POLC-Orchestration, Quality Professor, Implementation Guard)
- Strict separation of duties — Foreman never executes, always delegates
- Multi-task orchestration with parallel/sequential/chained patterns
- Mode transition recording in session memory
- Tier 2 knowledge stubs (specialist-registry, domain-flag-index)

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
- `.github/agents/foreman-v2.agent.md` — Added Section 1.6 (Hard Separation of Duties), Section 3.4 (Multi-Task Orchestration), updated Section 4.2 (session memory required fields)
- `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/index.md` — Updated to v1.1.0, references new knowledge files
- `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/specialist-registry.md` — NEW: Agent delegation registry
- `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/domain-flag-index.md` — NEW: Mode/orchestration flags
- `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-001-20260221.md` — NEW: This file (historical risk log)
- `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-001-20260221.md` — NEW: Prehandover proof

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Added constitutional hard separation of duties (Section 1.6) with historical risk note
- Action 2: Added multi-task orchestration patterns (parallel, sequential, chained) with full example
- Action 3: Updated session memory schema to require mode transitions and roles_invoked fields
- Action 4: Created Tier 2 specialist-registry.md listing all delegable agents and boundaries
- Action 5: Created Tier 2 domain-flag-index.md with mode flags and domain boundaries
- Action 6: Updated knowledge/index.md to v1.1.0 with references to new files

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Added Section 1.6 as a new constitutional section in Phase 1 (Preflight) — placing it here ensures it activates BEFORE any task execution
- Decision 2: Multi-task orchestration added as Section 3.4 in Phase 3 (Build/Orchestration) — this is where wave orchestration logic lives
- Decision 3: Session memory schema updated in Phase 4 (Handover) to capture mode transitions and roles_invoked — creates permanent audit trail

## Historical Risk Record

**Risk ID**: RISK-FM-V2-001  
**Type**: Governance Boundary Violation Risk  
**Status**: MITIGATED by this session  

**Description**: Prior Foreman contract versions (v1.x and early v2.x, pre-2026-02-21) did not have an explicit constitutional prohibition against Foreman directly executing governance file operations or agent contract modifications. This created a non-zero risk that Foreman could operate outside POLC boundaries when faced with governance or agent-file tasks.

**Evidence of Risk**: No explicit "Hard Separation of Duties" section existed in the contract. The "prohibited" list in capabilities only mentioned "Writing production code" and "Running GitHub platform actions" — it did not explicitly cover governance edits or agent file modifications.

**Mitigation**: Section 1.6 (Hard Separation of Duties) added to contract v2.1.0 as a constitutional FM_H requirement. All governance file and agent file operations now explicitly require delegation to `governance-liaison-isms-agent` or `CodexAdvisor-agent` respectively.

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-001-20260221.md`
- Status: COMPLETE

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple dispatched (consumer repository — receive-only)
- Ripple required: NO (contract upgrade, not canon change)

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Gap addressed — prior lack of explicit separation of duties documented and mitigated
- Gap logged: RISK-FM-V2-001 (above)

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Clean — no placeholder hashes, no degraded mode triggers

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons
### What Worked Well
- The four-phase contract structure made it easy to insert the new separation-of-duties section in Phase 1 (constitutional) where it belongs
- Mode transition logging added to Phase 4 session memory schema creates a permanent audit trail across all future sessions

### What Was Challenging
- Balancing comprehensiveness with the 30K character limit — used compact format and references

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Section 1.6 is now the primary constitutional reference for separation of duties — always check it first when receiving a task
- The `specialist-registry.md` is the definitive lookup for which agent handles which task type
- Mode transitions must ALWAYS be logged in session memory under `mode_transitions` field

### Governance Insights
- The absence of an explicit "never edit governance files" prohibition in v1.x was a latent governance gap — it's now addressed
- Hard separation of duties (Section 1.6) should be cross-referenced in the checklist for future contract reviews
