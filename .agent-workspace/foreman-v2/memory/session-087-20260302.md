## Wave Summary

**Wave type**: Step 0 cosmetic governance fix + HALT-001 standby. No code changes. No builder delegation.

**Governance artifacts updated this session**:
1. `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/index.md` — version table row for `index.md` corrected from `1.2.0` to `1.6.0` (cosmetic drift from PR #785; file header correctly showed v1.6.0 but table row was not updated through v1.3.0→v1.6.0 progression)
2. `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-087-wave13-step0-20260302.md` — CREATED
3. `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-087-20260302.md` — CREATED (this file)

## Knowledge Maintenance Actions

```yaml
knowledge_maintenance_actions:
  - file: .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/index.md
    action: Update version table row for index.md from 1.2.0 to 1.6.1 (header bumped to 1.6.1 per OVL-KG-002; Version History table added per OVL-KG-003)
    reason: Cosmetic drift — file header correctly showed 1.6.0 since v1.3.0→v1.6.0 progression; table cell was not updated. Identified during PR #785 review per issue #788 Step 0 directive. Version bumped to 1.6.1 on edit per version-on-edit policy.
    commit_message: "fix(knowledge): sync index.md version table row to 1.6.1, bump version, add Version History table (cosmetic drift from PR #785)"
```

## Delegation Log

## Wave 13 Status

**HALT-001 ACTIVE**: Wave 13 builder delegation has NOT begun. CS2 (@APGI-cmy) wave-start authorization has not been received on issue #788 (only the github-actions[bot] preflight reminder comment is present). Foreman is in STANDBY awaiting CS2 authorization.

**Entry criteria status** (as of this session):
- [ ] CS2 wave-start authorization — NOT YET RECEIVED
- [ ] 559/559 baseline tests GREEN — to be confirmed after CS2 authorization
- [x] Architecture FROZEN confirmed — per issue #788 ("Architecture Status: FROZEN")
- [x] RCA MAT-RCA-002 FINAL confirmed — `modules/mat/05-rca/RCA_WAVE12_POST_DEPLOYMENT_WIRING_FAILURES_20260302.md`
- [x] PR #785 merged — confirmed (per issue #788 entry criteria)
- [x] Wave 12 CS2-certified COMPLETE — confirmed (IAA-session-026/029/030-20260301-PASS per issue #788)

## Suggestions for Improvement

No degradation observed. Continuous improvement note: Step 0 cosmetic fixes like this version table drift should ideally be caught automatically — a CI lint check that compares the `| index.md |` table row version against the file's `**Knowledge Version:**` header field would prevent silent drift through multiple version increments. This is consistent with S-006 (automated FAIL-ONLY-ONCE status validation) and extends that principle to knowledge version consistency.
