## Roles Invoked

```yaml
roles_invoked:
  - POLC-Orchestration
  - Quality-Professor
```

## Mode Transitions

```yaml
mode_transitions:
  - STANDBY → POLC-Orchestration (CS2 wave-start authorization confirmed — Issue #622 by @APGI-cmy)
  - POLC-Orchestration → Quality-Professor (governance-liaison-isms-agent template delivery received)
  - Quality-Professor → HANDOVER (QP PASS — Gate 6 present at line 145 + item 12 at line 305)
```

---

## Agents Delegated To

```yaml
agents_delegated_to:
  - agent: governance-liaison-isms-agent
    task: >
      Update governance/templates/PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md:
      - Add Gate 6: Deployment Gate Confirmation (MANDATORY — Issue #622)
      - Insert between Gate 5 and Stop-and-Fix Compliance sections
      - Add item 12 to Handover Certification: "Deployment gate confirmed (PASS or N/A with
        documented justification) — Issue #622 mandatory check"
    outcome: DELIVERED — Gate 6 at line 145, item 12 at line 305. QP PASS.
```

## Escalations Triggered

```yaml
escalations_triggered: none
```

---

## Separation Violations Detected

```yaml
separation_violations_detected: none
```

Foreman did not write any production code. The PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE update was delegated to governance-liaison-isms-agent as required. Foreman authored only Phase 4 governance artifacts (session memory, PREHANDOVER proof, parking station entry) as explicitly permitted by the contract.

## Wave Outcome Summary

| Deliverable | File | Status |
|---|---|---|
| PREHANDOVER template Gate 6 | `governance/templates/PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md` | ✅ DELIVERED by governance-liaison |
| PREHANDOVER proof | `.agent-admin/prehandover/proof-wave8-deployment-gate-fix-20260226.md` | ✅ CREATED |
| Session memory (this file) | `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-060-20260226.md` | ✅ CREATED |
| Parking station | `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md` | ✅ UPDATED |

**Wave 8 (AIMC Analysis Integration) Status**: BLOCKED — awaiting AIMC Wave 4. Confirmed in PREHANDOVER proof and this session memory. Wave 8 code delivery cannot proceed until Wave 4 delivers required integration surface.

## Suggestions for Improvement

**S-009 (new — this session)**: Gate 6 is now in the template as a manual checklist obligation. The next logical enforcement step is to add a CI check in `merge-gate-interface.yml` (or a new dedicated workflow) that parses the PREHANDOVER proof and fails the PR if Gate 6 status is not completed or is `PENDING`. This converts Gate 6 from a soft template obligation to a machine-enforced gate — the same pattern used for S-004 (evidence bundle presence check, now implemented in `governance-hardening.yml`).

## Parking Station

Appended to `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md`:

```
| 2026-02-26 | foreman-v2-agent | session-060 | [SESSION-END] | Gate 6 (Deployment Gate) now in PREHANDOVER template — next step: CI check to machine-enforce Gate 6 completion, converting soft obligation to hard gate (S-009) | session-060-20260226.md |
```
