# Session Memory — session-046-20260221

**Date**: 2026-02-21  
**Agent**: foreman-v2-agent  
**Authority**: CS2 — fix authorised to resolve Copilot agent dropdown visibility issue

---

## Summary

Fixed `foreman-v2-agent` not appearing in the GitHub Copilot agent dropdown.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed `foreman-v2-agent.md` YAML frontmatter (`model:` field placement)

- **Problem**: `model: claude-sonnet-4-5` was at the top level of YAML frontmatter; GitHub Copilot's agent loader reads `model` from under `agent:`.
- **Fix**: Removed `model: claude-sonnet-4-5` from top level; added `model: claude-sonnet-4-5` nested under `agent:` between `contract_pattern` and the next field.

### 2. Moved `BUILDER_CONTRACT_SCHEMA.md` out of `.github/agents/`

- **Problem**: `.github/agents/BUILDER_CONTRACT_SCHEMA.md` is a schema documentation file (not an agent), has no `name:` frontmatter, and exceeds the 30,000 character agent file limit. Its presence may cause the Copilot agent loader to error when scanning.
- **Fix**: Moved to `governance/schemas/BUILDER_CONTRACT_SCHEMA.md`.
- Updated self-reference (`Location:` field) inside the file to reflect new path.

---

## Files Changed

1. `.github/agents/foreman-v2-agent.md` — moved `model:` from top-level to under `agent:`
2. `.github/agents/BUILDER_CONTRACT_SCHEMA.md` — removed (moved to `governance/schemas/`)
3. `governance/schemas/BUILDER_CONTRACT_SCHEMA.md` — created (moved from `.github/agents/`); updated Location field

---
