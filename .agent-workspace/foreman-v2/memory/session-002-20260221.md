# Session 002 - 20260221 (LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: foreman-v2
- Class: foreman (supervisor)
- Session ID: session-002-20260221
- Contract Version: 2.2.0

## Task
Align foreman-v2 contract to ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md v1.1.0 (Feb 2026 canon update):
- Update all ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md version references from v1.0.0 → v1.1.0
- Bump contract version from 2.1.0 to 2.2.0
- Update Tier 2 knowledge index to reference v1.1.0
- Record alignment evidence in session memory and PREHANDOVER proof

## What I Did

### Files Modified
- `.github/agents/foreman-v2.agent.md` — Updated ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md version refs (v1.0.0 → v1.1.0); bumped contract to v2.2.0
- `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/index.md` — Updated ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md ref to v1.1.0; bumped contract ref to v2.2.0
- `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-002-20260221.md` — NEW: This file
- `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-002-20260221.md` — NEW: Prehandover proof

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Updated 7 occurrences of `ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md v1.0.0` → v1.1.0 in contract
- Action 2: Updated contract_version and description fields from 2.1.0 → 2.2.0
- Action 3: Updated knowledge/index.md contract and vocabulary version references
- Action 4: Created session-002 memory and PREHANDOVER proof

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Bumped to v2.2.0 (minor version) — this is a non-functional alignment update, not a structural change
- Decision 2: No changes to Verb Classification Gate trigger verbs — v1.1.0 added vocabulary definitions (layering down/up, rippling) but did not add new Mode Reference Table entries
- Decision 3: All prior session-001 content and Tier 2 stubs remain unchanged; only version refs updated

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-002-20260221.md`
- Status: COMPLETE

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple dispatched (consumer repository — receive-only)
- Ripple required: NO (contract alignment, not canon change)

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Gap resolved — contract now references ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md v1.1.0 (was v1.0.0)
- Note: ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md was updated from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0 on 2026-02-21 (same day as contract creation); this session closes the version drift

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Clean — no placeholder hashes, no degraded mode triggers

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons
### What Worked Well
- Version references are concentrated in well-identified sections, making the update surgical

### What Was Challenging
- Multiple v1.0.0 occurrences required careful enumeration to avoid missing any

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md is a living document (v1.x series); always verify current version at session start
- Any new vocabulary terms added to ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md that appear in the Mode Reference Table require a Verb Classification Gate update

### Governance Insights
- Consumer contract version refs to vocabulary canon must be updated whenever the vocab doc is updated, even if Verb Classification Gate logic is unchanged
