## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY — non-blank)

- The five LAS v6.2.0 gaps were all implied by existing governance language but never given explicit named step identities in Phase 1/3/4. Future contract evolutions should use a named-step-first approach: every requirement gets a named step (e.g., "OPOJD Gate") before implicit language is relied upon, preventing the same class of gap from recurring.
