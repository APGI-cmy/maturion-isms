## Roles Invoked

```
roles_invoked: [POLC-Orchestration, Implementation Guard, Quality Professor]
mode_transitions:
  1. STANDBY → IMPLEMENTATION_GUARD (verb: implement, directed at Foreman — A-009 triggered)
  2. IMPLEMENTATION_GUARD → POLC_ORCHESTRATION (task spec created, delegated)
  3. POLC_ORCHESTRATION → QUALITY_PROFESSOR (after each builder handover — mandatory per contract)
  4. QUALITY_PROFESSOR → POLC_ORCHESTRATION (QP PASS × 4 → continue wave)
  5. POLC_ORCHESTRATION → PHASE_4_HANDOVER (after §4.3 merge gate parity PASS)
```

## Agents Delegated To

| Agent | Task | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| qa-builder | Define 45 Red gate tests for AI Gateway (test_health, test_routes, test_services_exist, test_environment, conftest) | DELIVERED — 45 tests RED (19 failed, 23 errors). QP: PASS |
| api-builder (pass 1) | Implement apps/mat-ai-gateway/ FastAPI app (main.py, 5 services, 5 routes, Dockerfile, requirements.txt, README, .dockerignore) + .github/workflows/deploy-mat-ai-gateway.yml | DELIVERED — 45 tests GREEN. QP: PASS |
| api-builder (pass 2) | .gitignore Python patterns, apps/mat-ai-gateway/.gitignore, DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK_MAT.md AG.1-AG.9 | DELIVERED — 45 tests still GREEN. QP: PASS |
| api-builder (pass 3) | Code review fixes: reporting.py format→report_format, ai_routes.py Any→list[Union[str,dict]] | DELIVERED — 45 tests still GREEN. QP: PASS |

```
agents_delegated_to: [qa-builder (Wave 10 Red tests), api-builder × 3 (gateway implementation, cleanup, code review fixes)]
```

## Escalations

```
escalations_triggered: none
```

---

## Separation Violations

```
separation_violations_detected: none
```

Foreman did not write any production code. All implementation delegated to builder agents. A-001 observed throughout.

---

## IAA Invocation

```
iaa_audit_token: IAA-session-018-20260228-PASS
```

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

No degradation observed. Continuous improvement note: The QA-first pattern (qa-builder defines Red tests → api-builder implements to Green) worked cleanly this session. The 4-pass delegation model (Red tests → implementation → cleanup → code review fixes) produced clean, well-structured deliverables with zero test debt. Suggestion: Document this 4-pass delegation pattern as a named orchestration pattern in domain-flag-index.md for reuse in future multi-component waves.
