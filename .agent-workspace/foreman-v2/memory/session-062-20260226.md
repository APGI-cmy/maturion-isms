## Session Preamble

```yaml
phase_1_preflight: COMPLETE
fail_only_once_attested: true
fail_only_once_version: 1.7.0
unresolved_breaches: none
open_improvements_reviewed: [S-001, S-002, S-003, S-004, S-005, S-006, S-007, S-008]
```

Note: This session started fresh (previous session-061 commits were not pushed — lost on branch reset). All 5 items re-implemented from scratch.

  - session-060-20260226
  - session-061-20260226 (commits lost — not pushed)
```

## Unresolved Items from Prior Sessions

```yaml
unresolved_items_from_prior_sessions:
  - "session-061 commits not pushed — full re-implementation required this session"
```

## Phase 1 Evidence

```yaml
identity_declared: true
agent_id: foreman-v2-agent
tier2_loaded: true
tier2_version: "1.4.0"
tier1_canon_verified: true
canon_inventory_hash_check: PASS
merge_gate_checks_loaded: true
cs2_authorization: CONFIRMED (Issue #628 by @APGI-cmy)
```

## Roles Invoked

```yaml
roles_invoked:
  - POLC-Orchestration
  - Implementation-Guard (task verbs classified as builder scope)
  - Quality-Professor (x2 — after each builder delivery)
```

---

## Mode Transitions

```yaml
mode_transitions:
  - STANDBY → IMPLEMENTATION_GUARD (implement/fix/add verbs directed at wave scope)
  - IMPLEMENTATION_GUARD → POLC-Orchestration (classified as builder work)
  - POLC-Orchestration → Quality-Professor (api-builder delivery)
  - Quality-Professor → POLC-Orchestration (QP PASS — 322 tests)
  - POLC-Orchestration → Quality-Professor (integration-builder delivery)
  - Quality-Professor → HANDOVER (QP PASS — 328 tests, code review 0 comments)
```

## Agents Delegated To

```yaml
agents_delegated_to:
  - agent: api-builder
    items: "1 (Supabase wiring), 2 (GET pending), 3 (userId from JWT)"
    outcome: "322 tests passing. Real clients wired. pending.ts created. JWT extraction implemented."
    qp_verdict: PASS

  - agent: integration-builder
    items: "4 (@deprecated on 6 hooks), 5 (freeze doc amendment)"
    outcome: "328 tests passing. All 6 hooks deprecated. Freeze doc has 2 amendment entries."
    qp_verdict: PASS
```

## Escalations Triggered

```yaml
escalations_triggered: none
```

---

## Separation Violations Detected

```yaml
separation_violations_detected: none
```

## §4.3 Merge Gate Parity

```yaml
merge_gate_parity: PASS
tests_pass: 328
pre_existing_failures: 1 (EpisodicMemoryAdapter.test.ts — Wave 9.3 waived)
new_failures: 0
code_review_comments: 0
```

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **A-011 candidate — PR checklist cross-check**: Before every QP PASS verdict, the Foreman MUST explicitly cross-check all PR body checklist items. Any unchecked [ ] item is automatic QP FAIL. This session (062) and its predecessor (061) exist entirely because PR #614 was accepted with 5 unchecked items. Add to FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md as A-011.

2. **Session commit push resilience**: Session 061 lost all commits because the push failed (access denied). A pre-commit push verification step should be added to the foreman-v2 agent workflow — detect push failure at report_progress time and retry via different credentials. This is currently an environment limitation but should be tracked.

3. **Parallel builder delegation works cleanly**: Both api-builder and integration-builder were delegated in parallel this session. The parallel pattern is stable for independent item sets with no shared files. Integration-builder's changes were staged but not committed — the Foreman must explicitly commit staged changes after parallel builder returns (not rely on the builder to commit).
