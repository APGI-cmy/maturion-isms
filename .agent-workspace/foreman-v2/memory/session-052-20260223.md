## Task Summary

CS2-directed issue required:
1. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for governance breach GOV-BREACH-AIMC-W2-001 (foreman self-implementing in PR #468)
2. Learning loop activation — update personal lessons-learned with breach lesson
3. Parking station items tracked: TelemetryWriter counter scoping + AICentre double health check
4. Orchestration mandate documented for Wave 3+

---

## RCA Findings

### Root Cause (Primary)

The foreman-v2 contract at the time of PR #468 stated the POLC obligation ("never implement") but lacked:
- An explicit hard-stop enforcement clause blocking code-writing when no builder is available
- A mandatory CS2 escalation path with "builder unavailable → halt + escalate, NOT self-implement"

### Contributing Factors

1. **Missing hard-stop in specialist-registry.md**: No explicit "no-builder fallback" row specifying escalation.
2. **Pre-wave agent availability gate was non-blocking**: Phase 2 Alignment checked availability but didn't halt the wave when builders were unconfirmed.

### What Did NOT Cause the Breach

- Not a misunderstanding of POLC model
- Not a CS2 instruction to self-implement
- Not a canon gap at governance level

## Parking Station Items (Wave 4 / Wave 3)

### TD-AIMC-01: TelemetryWriter Process-Wide Counter
- **File**: `packages/ai-centre/src/telemetry/TelemetryWriter.ts`
- **Issue**: Module-level `let counter = 0` is process-scoped. Restarting the process resets it; multiple instances share the same counter.
- **Risk**: Low for Wave 2 (single-process, in-memory store). Must be replaced before Wave 4 Supabase integration.
- **Target Wave**: Wave 4
- **Resolution**: Replace with UUID-based ID generation or persistent Supabase sequence.

### TD-AIMC-02: AICentre Double Health Check
- **File**: `packages/ai-centre/src/gateway/AICentre.ts` (line ~70)
- **Issue**: `if (this.config.healthRegistry.getHealth(providerName) === ProviderHealthStatus.UNAVAILABLE)` inside provider loop is redundant — `resolveProviders()` at line 55 already filters out UNAVAILABLE providers.
- **Risk**: Tolerable in Wave 2. Minor dead-code / misleading logic.
- **Target Wave**: Wave 3 or 4
- **Resolution**: Remove the redundant UNAVAILABLE guard from the provider loop.

## Wave 3 Orchestration Mandate

Per CS2 direction:
1. `foreman-v2` is POLC supervisor only — no code writing under any circumstance.
2. Builder agents must be explicitly appointed before any implementation begins.
3. If a builder is unavailable → HALT + ESCALATE TO CS2. Wave does not start.
4. Any PR where foreman self-implements will be rejected on POLC violation.
5. Prehandover proof is mandatory for every wave closure.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Pre-wave builder availability gate as hard CI check**: Implement a GitHub Actions step that pings each required builder agent and fails the wave-start workflow if any builder is unresponsive. This converts the soft availability check (Phase 2 Alignment) into a machine-enforced gate — preventing a repeat of GOV-BREACH-AIMC-W2-001.

2. **Continuous improvement note**: Add a periodic (per-wave) review of `specialist-registry.md` to ensure all builder agents are current and their delegation triggers are unambiguous. Stale registry entries create the "no builder available" ambiguity that contributed to the breach.

## Parking Station Append

| 2026-02-23 | foreman-v2 | session-052 | TD: TelemetryWriter process-wide counter must be replaced with persistent/UUID-based ID generation in Wave 4 | `session-052-20260223.md` |
| 2026-02-23 | foreman-v2 | session-052 | TD: AICentre provider loop contains a redundant UNAVAILABLE guard — already filtered by router; mark for clean-up in Wave 3 or 4 | `session-052-20260223.md` |
