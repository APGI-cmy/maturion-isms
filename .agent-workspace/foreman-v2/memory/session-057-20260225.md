## Suggestions for Improvement

Wave 8 completes all 8 planned capability waves for `@maturion/ai-centre`. The wave execution
pattern (RED gate → api-builder → QP → handover) is now well-established across 6 build waves.

Continuous improvement note: The delegation specification pre-authoring pattern (foreman writes
the builder delegation spec in Phase 2 before CS2 wave-start is confirmed) proved effective —
it minimised latency between CS2 authorization and builder start. This pattern should be codified
in the AAWP template for future module builds.
