## Task Summary

**Issue**: GOVERNANCE_LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md was merged into canonical governance repo (PR #1181), but no auto-layer-down issue was created in maturion-isms. Foreman was asked to:
1. Investigate why auto-layer-down failed
2. Orchestrate layer-up protocol infrastructure implementation
3. Provide QA/validation proof

---

## Investigation Findings

**Root Cause**: `maturion-isms` had no `repository_dispatch` listener. The canonical governance repo's `governance-ripple-dispatch.yml` dispatches `repository_dispatch: governance_ripple` events, but isms only had `ripple-integration.yml` which listens for issues (not repository_dispatch). All incoming ripple dispatches were silently dropped.

Full analysis: `LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL_RCA_AND_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

## Deliverables Created

1. **`.github/workflows/governance-ripple-sync.yml`** (NEW)
   - Closes the `repository_dispatch` gap
   - Handles `repository_dispatch: governance_ripple` from canonical governance repo
   - Includes CS2 gate for agent contract changes
   - Includes auto-merge for non-agent-file changes
   - Matches parity with `ripple-integration.yml` logic

2. **`.github/workflows/layer-up-dispatch.yml`** (NEW)
   - Automates LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL Phase 3 (escalation)
   - Triggers on issues labeled `layer-up` + `governance-improvement`
   - Creates issue in `maturion-foreman-governance` for governance intake
   - Comments on source issue with cross-reference
   - Records dispatch evidence
   - Respects authority boundary (creates issues only, no file modifications)

3. **`LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL_RCA_AND_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** (NEW)
   - Full root cause analysis
   - Implementation documentation
   - End-to-end flow description

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

**Concrete improvement**: The `governance-alignment-schedule.yml` runs every hour as a fallback. With `governance-ripple-sync.yml` now handling event-driven alignment, the hourly schedule could be reduced to daily to reduce CI noise and cost. This should be evaluated after a period of validation that the event-driven path is reliable.
