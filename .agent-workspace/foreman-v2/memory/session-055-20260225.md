## Roles Invoked

**roles_invoked**: [POLC-Orchestration, Implementation Guard, Quality Professor]

**mode_transitions**:
1. SESSION_START → Phase 1 PREFLIGHT (all 7 steps executed, agent file read FIRST per A-011)
2. PREFLIGHT → [MODE:IMPLEMENTATION_GUARD] (verb: "Implement" directed at Foreman → immediate rejection)
3. IMPLEMENTATION_GUARD → [MODE:POLC_ORCHESTRATION] (create builder task specifications, delegate)
4. POLC_ORCHESTRATION → delegation to qa-builder (RED gate tests)
5. qa-builder handover → [MODE:QUALITY_PROFESSOR] (QP FAIL — preflight not evidenced)
6. QP_FAIL → [MODE:POLC_ORCHESTRATION] → re-delegation to qa-builder with mandatory preflight requirement
7. qa-builder re-delivery → [MODE:QUALITY_PROFESSOR] (QP PASS — preflight evidenced)
8. QP_PASS → [MODE:POLC_ORCHESTRATION] → delegation to api-builder (implementation)
9. api-builder handover → [MODE:QUALITY_PROFESSOR] (full diff review, stub check, test verification)
10. QP_PASS → Phase 4 HANDOVER preparation

## Agents Delegated To

**agents_delegated_to**:
- `qa-builder`: Wave 6 RED gate tests — wave6-cst.test.ts (4 tests) + contract test update. First delivery QP FAIL (preflight missing). Re-delivered with preflight evidence. QP PASS on second delivery.
- `api-builder`: AnthropicAdapter.ts, OpenAIAdapter.ts image-gen extension, course-crafter-advisor.md. Delivered with preflight evidence on first delegation. QP PASS.

## Escalations Triggered

**escalations_triggered**: none

## Separation Violations Detected

**separation_violations_detected**: none — Foreman wrote zero production code. All implementation delegated. A-001 observed.

## CS2 Correction Applied This Session

**CS2 new_requirement received**: "Builder agents are making the same mistake as you. They are not reading their files first. Include in your QP review and correct."

**Action taken**:
1. QP review criteria permanently expanded: Phase 1 preflight attestation is now a mandatory QP check for ALL builder deliverables (alongside test GREEN count, stub check, architecture compliance)
2. All delegation specifications now include Step 0 (mandatory preflight) as a blocking prerequisite
3. QP FAIL issued on qa-builder's first delivery; remediation order issued; re-delivery accepted after preflight evidenced
4. api-builder delegation spec included explicit mandatory preflight requirement from the start

**Governance note**: This mirrors the pattern from GOV-BREACH-AIMC-W5-002 (Foreman preflight) — the same class of violation now caught at the builder level. The fix is the same: make the requirement explicit in the delegation specification and verify it in QP review.

## Suggestions for Improvement

This session revealed a structural gap: Foreman's delegation specifications did not previously include a mandatory preflight requirement for builder agents, even though each builder's contract contains `NO-SKIP-001` ("No skipping wake-up or session closure protocols"). The fix is now active for this and all future sessions — preflight is a non-negotiable checklist item in both the delegation spec and the QP review.

**Concrete improvement suggestion**: Add a delegation template to Foreman Tier 2 knowledge (`specialist-registry.md` or a new `delegation-template.md`) that includes Step 0 preflight as a boilerplate first section in every builder task specification. This converts the requirement from an ad-hoc instruction to a systematic enforcement mechanism.
