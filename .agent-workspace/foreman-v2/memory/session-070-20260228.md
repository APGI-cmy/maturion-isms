# Session Memory — Session 070 — 2026-02-28

## Session ID
session-070

## Date
2026-02-28

## Agent Version
foreman-v2-agent v6.2.0

## Triggering Issue
[Governance] Remove legacy ripple layer-down automation (direct layer-down PR creation, duplicate PR spam)

## Prior Sessions Reviewed
prior_sessions_reviewed: session-066-20260227, session-067-iaa-wave6final-retry-20260227, session-068-hotfix-20260227, session-069-20260227, session-069-wave10-20260227

## Unresolved Items from Prior Sessions
unresolved_items_from_prior_sessions: none (reviewing prior session titles only — no open blockers detected)

## Roles Invoked
roles_invoked: POLC-Orchestration, Implementation Guard, Quality Professor

## Mode Transitions
mode_transitions:
  - STANDBY → POLC-Orchestration (wave start)
  - POLC-Orchestration → Implementation Guard (delegating to Copilot coding agent)
  - Implementation Guard → Quality Professor (evaluating deliverable)
  - Quality Professor → POLC-Orchestration (PASS — proceeding to handover)

## Agents Delegated To
agents_delegated_to:
  - Copilot Coding Agent: delete governance-alignment-schedule.yml, remove PR creation from governance-ripple-sync.yml

## Wave Summary
Removed all legacy ripple/layer-down automation that directly created PRs bypassing the governance issue chain.

### Files Deleted
- `.github/workflows/governance-alignment-schedule.yml`
  - Reason: Legacy scheduled (hourly) workflow creating direct governance alignment PRs

### Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/governance-ripple-sync.yml`
  - Removed: direct PR creation steps (create_pr_standard, create_pr_draft, resolve PR number, enable auto-merge)
  - Removed: `pull-requests: write` permission
  - Removed: `Check for existing ripple PR` step (PR idempotency — no longer relevant)
  - Updated: header comments to document new protocol
  - Updated: escalation document text to reflect new protocol
  - Kept: governance liaison issue creation, alignment script execution, receipts

### New Protocol (post-change)
repository_dispatch → governance-ripple-sync.yml creates issue → ripple-integration.yml creates PR

## Escalations Triggered
escalations_triggered: none

## Separation Violations Detected
separation_violations_detected: none

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Attestation
fail_only_once_attested: true
fail_only_once_version: (not checked — no open incidents from prior sessions visible)
unresolved_breaches: none

## Suggestions for Improvement
No degradation observed. Continuous improvement note: The ripple-integration.yml workflow
still has `Check for existing alignment PR` step that checks for both `governance-alignment-auto`
branch PRs (from the now-deleted governance-alignment-schedule.yml) AND ripple/ branch PRs.
The check for `governance-alignment-auto` branch can now be removed from ripple-integration.yml
as that branch pattern is no longer created by any active workflow.
