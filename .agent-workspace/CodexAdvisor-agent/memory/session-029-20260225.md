## Session Summary

**Task**: Implement post-PR#534 learning — add permanent no-class-exception IAA rule to
CodexAdvisor's own Tier 2 knowledge (FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md and agent-file-non-negotiables-checklist).
This prevents CodexAdvisor from ever again claiming a class exemption for IAA invocation.

Actions completed:
1. Created `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/knowledge/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md` with A-001 rule:
   IAA invocation mandatory for all agent contract PRs, no class exceptions, cross-referenced
   to IAA FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-002. Triggered by maturion-isms#523, #528, #531.
2. Updated `agent-file-non-negotiables-checklist.md` v1.1.0 → v1.2.0:
   - Added S2-09 gate: IAA invocation evidence required for any agent contract PR, BLOCKING,
     no class exceptions.
   - Updated Compliance Gate table to include IAA evidence row.
3. Updated `index.md` v1.1.0 → v1.2.0:
   - Registered FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md in the knowledge table.
4. Created PREHANDOVER proof and session memory (this file).

**Outcome**: COMPLETED
**QP Verdict**: PASS

## IAA Invocation Result

**IAA_REQUIRED**: NO (Tier 2 knowledge-only update — no agent contract created or modified)
**IAA result**: NOT_REQUIRED
**Basis**: This PR modifies only `.agent-workspace/` Tier 2 knowledge files and session memory.
No `.github/agents/*.md` agent contract files were created or modified.

---

## Permanent Rule Recorded (Meta-Governance Safeguard)

**Rule ID**: A-001 (FAIL-ONLY-ONCE)
**Recorded**: 2026-02-25
**Authority**: CS2 (Johan Ras) — maturion-isms#535 (learning from #523, #528, #531)
**Location**: `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/knowledge/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md` A-001
**Summary**: IAA invocation is mandatory for ALL agent contract updates. No class exceptions.
Double-QA is constitutional. Cross-reference IAA FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-002.

---

## Agents Created/Updated

None (Tier 2 knowledge-only session).

---

## Next Session Notes

- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md is now active. CodexAdvisor must load it in Phase 1 Step 1.5 each session.
- S2-09 in the non-negotiables checklist is now BLOCKING — any future agent contract PR must
  include IAA evidence before PR is opened.
- When CodexAdvisor's own contract is next updated, reference FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md in Phase 1.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

The FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md was absent from CodexAdvisor's Tier 2 knowledge until this session, despite
the IAA-INVOKE-001 / A-002 rule having been codified in IAA's registry since PR #534. Recommendation:
add a cross-agent synchronisation gate — when a new rule is added to any agent's FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md
that affects CodexAdvisor's behaviour (e.g., IAA A-002), CodexAdvisor's own registry should be
updated in the same PR. This prevents a delay between IAA learning a rule and CodexAdvisor learning
the same rule.
