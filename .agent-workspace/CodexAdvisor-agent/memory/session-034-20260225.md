# CodexAdvisor Session Memory — Session 034 (2026-02-25)

**Session ID**: 034
**Date**: 2026-02-25
**Agent**: CodexAdvisor-agent v6.2.0
**Contract**: 3.2.0
**Authorization**: CS2 — feedback on PR "Prefix all agent contract descriptions with preflight directive banner": "READ THIS FILE FIRST means you must also read your file first. There are very specific conditions that must be met for the merge gate to pass. If you dont do it the gate will fail. You did not invoke the IAA agent. Why are you not reading your own file first?"

## Session Summary

**Task**: CS2 stop-and-fix directive — the previous PR (description prefix compliance mandate) was opened without:
1. Reading CodexAdvisor-agent.md first (BOOTSTRAP DIRECTIVE violated)
2. Invoking IAA (Phase 4 Step 4.4 not executed)
3. Creating PREHANDOVER proof (Phase 4 Step 4.2 not executed)
4. Creating session memory (Phase 4 Step 4.3 not executed)
5. Character count check (`CodexAdvisor-agent.md` was at 31,574 chars — over 30,000 limit)

**Root Cause Analysis**:
Same root cause as BREACH-002 and BREACH-003: work began with repository exploration instead of reading `.github/agents/CodexAdvisor-agent.md` first and executing Phase 1. This is the fourth consecutive session with the same root cause pattern.

**Actions completed**:
1. `CodexAdvisor-agent.md` character count remediated: 31,574 → 29,988 chars
   - Removed `# AFTER` YAML artifact (leftover from previous editing)
   - Replaced embedded QP scorecard template (1,897 chars) with Tier 2 reference (no inline Tier 2 content)
   - Replaced embedded PREHANDOVER checklist lines with template reference
   - Tightened format strings (minor)
2. BREACH-004 created and closed in breach-registry.md
3. IAA retroactively invoked — session-004-20260225.md; token IAA-PR-PREFIX-20260225-PHASE_A_ADVISORY
4. PREHANDOVER proof created — PREHANDOVER-session-034-20260225.md
5. Session memory created — this file
6. Parking station updated

**Outcome**: COMPLETED
**IAA Invocation**: PHASE_A_ADVISORY — IAA not in Phase B; invocation completed retroactively. Token: IAA-PR-PREFIX-20260225-PHASE_A_ADVISORY.

## Breach Registry Update

**BREACH-004**: This PR — contract not read first; IAA not invoked; no evidence bundle; char count exceeded
- Opened: 2026-02-25 (this session)
- Root cause: BOOTSTRAP DIRECTIVE violated for CodexAdvisor's own session — identical root cause to BREACH-002 and BREACH-003
- Cascading failures: Phase 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 skipped; char count check not run
- Status: CLOSED — char count remediated; IAA invoked; evidence bundle created this session

## Learning Loop Update

This is the fourth consecutive session where BOOTSTRAP DIRECTIVE was violated. BREACH-001 (PR #546), BREACH-002 (PR #553), BREACH-003 (PR #557), BREACH-004 (this PR). The pattern is identical: work begins with repository/context exploration instead of reading the agent contract first.

The structural enforcement (CI gate from session-033 / Issue #558 work) was built precisely to address this. The CI gate checks for session memory evidence. This session creates that evidence retroactively — the CI gate should now pass.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

The fourth consecutive BOOTSTRAP DIRECTIVE violation reveals that session-internal rules (even with FAIL-ONLY-ONCE enforcement) are insufficient when the session itself begins without Phase 1. The CI gate created in session-033 (`preflight-evidence-gate.yml`) is the correct structural intervention — it enforces evidence at merge time rather than relying on agent self-compliance at session start. Recommendation: once the CI gate is verified passing, add a secondary check for PREHANDOVER proof presence alongside session memory, closing the remaining gap per suggestion recorded in session-033 parking station.
