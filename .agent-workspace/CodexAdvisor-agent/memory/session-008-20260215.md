# Session 008 - 20260215 (LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: CodexAdvisor-agent
- Class: overseer
- Session ID: session-008-20260215

## Task
Update Builder Contract Binding Checklist to include BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER update requirement as a mandatory deliverable for wave completion PRs.

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)

1. **governance/canon/BUILDER_CONTRACT_BINDING_CHECKLIST.md**
   - SHA256: `92fcfa075ef93181f29ec2b01b88426c7c3279f1dba9da480f84ef95751adbda`
   - Version updated: 1.2.0 → 1.3.0
   - Last Updated: 2026-02-15 (Added A.7.4 BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER Update Requirements)
   - Added new section A.7.4 with BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER update requirements

2. **BUILDER_CHECKLIST_TRACKER_UPDATE_EVIDENCE.md** (Created)
   - SHA256: `393d430d1cef01d57914e383548edc99728fe09e491ca1c971c22c6199caeedc`
   - Comprehensive evidence document for this governance change

### Actions Taken

1. **Wake-up Protocol**: Executed `.github/scripts/wake-up-protocol.sh CodexAdvisor-agent` - All phases PASSED
2. **File Location**: Located target file `governance/canon/BUILDER_CONTRACT_BINDING_CHECKLIST.md`
3. **Structure Analysis**: Identified section A.7 Evidence Production Requirements with subsections A.7.1, A.7.2, A.7.3
4. **Version Update**: Incremented version from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0 with update note
5. **Content Addition**: Added new A.7.4 section between A.7.3 and A.8 with complete specification
6. **Evidence Creation**: Created comprehensive evidence document with diff, validation criteria, and authority chain
7. **Git Commit**: Committed changes with descriptive message following governance standards

### Decisions Made

1. **Section Placement**: Placed A.7.4 immediately after A.7.3 (before A.8) to maintain logical flow within Evidence Production Requirements section
   - **Why**: A.7.4 is an evidence requirement, not a gate compliance requirement

2. **Severity Classification**: Set severity to HIGH (not CRITICAL or BLOCKER)
   - **Why**: Missing tracker update degrades audit trail but doesn't block execution or cause immediate system failure

3. **Requirement Trigger**: Made MANDATORY only for wave completion PRs (when IBWR evidence present)
   - **Why**: Not all builder PRs are wave completions; targeting the specific governance gap

4. **Enforcement Mechanism**: Specified merge gate BL-029 (`validate-tracker-update.sh`)
   - **Why**: Provides clear automation path and machine-checkable enforcement

5. **Canonical References**: Cited BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md, LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0, and governance/templates/IBWR_TEMPLATE.md
   - **Why**: Establishes multi-source authority and connects to existing governance framework

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: `BUILDER_CHECKLIST_TRACKER_UPDATE_EVIDENCE.md`
- Status: ✅ Complete with full diff, validation criteria, and authority chain

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple required (consumer repository mode)
- Ripple required: NO
- Note: Changes to `governance/canon/` in consumer repositories do not trigger ripple dispatch

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: ✅ Addressed governance gap from PRs #140, #142, #143
- Gap: Wave completion PRs failed to update BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md
- Resolution: Added explicit A.7.4 checklist requirement making tracker updates MANDATORY

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: ✅ Clean
- Wake-up protocol: PASSED all 7 phases
- CANON_INVENTORY: Accessible (version 1.0.0, 0 artifacts)
- Drift detection: No drift detected
- JSON validation: All JSON files valid

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

- Builder Contract Binding Checklist successfully updated to v1.3.0
- New A.7.4 section added with complete specification
- Evidence document created with full context
- Changes committed to branch `copilot/enforce-tracker-updates`
- Ready for Foreman (FM) review and CS2 approval

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
1. **Wake-up protocol**: Provided clear environment health baseline before making changes
2. **Section structure analysis**: Grep commands quickly located the correct insertion point
3. **Evidence-first approach**: Creating comprehensive evidence document establishes clear audit trail
4. **Version increment protocol**: Clear semantic versioning with update note in Last Updated field
5. **Authority chain declaration**: Explicit CodexAdvisor → FM → CS2 path clarifies approval workflow

### What Was Challenging
1. **File size**: Initial attempt to read full 52KB file failed; required strategic grep/view commands
2. **Section numbering**: Had to carefully place A.7.4 to maintain sequential numbering without disrupting A.8
3. **Canonical reference selection**: Chose 3 sources to balance authority without over-citing
4. **Severity classification**: Considered BLOCKER vs HIGH vs CRITICAL; chose HIGH based on audit trail impact
5. **Trigger specificity**: Defined "wave completion PRs" and "IBWR evidence present" as specific triggers

### What Future Sessions Should Know
1. **Large governance files**: Use grep to locate sections first, then view specific line ranges
2. **Version increments**: Always update both version number AND Last Updated field with change description
3. **Section placement**: New checklist items should be inserted within their logical parent section, maintaining sequential numbering
4. **Evidence documents**: Create evidence file BEFORE committing to ensure complete audit trail
5. **YAML format specs**: Include machine-checkable YAML format specification for all new requirements
6. **Canonical references**: Cite 2-3 authoritative sources; more weakens clarity, fewer weakens authority
7. **Session memory**: Remember to archive old sessions when count exceeds 5 (archiving needed after this session)

### Governance Insights
1. **Governance gap pattern**: Wave completion failures often stem from missing explicit checklist items, not from unclear policy
2. **Builder contracts**: Need machine-checkable validation hooks for all mandatory deliverables
3. **Evidence requirements**: BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER is part of audit trail discipline, not just documentation
4. **Merge gate design**: BL-029 should check for tracker updates when IBWR artifacts present
5. **Ripple awareness**: Changes to `governance/canon/` in consumer repositories are local-only (no dispatch)
6. **Authority model**: CodexAdvisor can propose governance changes but requires FM supervision and CS2 approval
7. **Version semantics**: Minor version increment (1.2 → 1.3) appropriate for additive changes that don't break existing contracts
