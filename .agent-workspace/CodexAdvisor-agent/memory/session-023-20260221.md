## Mode Transitions

- STANDBY → ALIGNMENT (CS2 authorization confirmed)
- ALIGNMENT → WORK (CANON_INVENTORY valid, self-modification prohibition observed)
- WORK → QP CHECK (all deliverables complete)
- QP CHECK → HANDOVER (QP PASS — all gates satisfied)

---

## QP Verdict

**PASS** — S6-06 correctly worded and placed after S6-05. Checklist version bumped to 1.1.0. `index.md` checklist entry updated. `suggestions-log.md` created with correct header format, session-022 backfill row, and session-023 row. Character count within limits. No governance weakening.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY — non-blank)

1. **Add S6-06 parking station append step to `session-memory-template.md`**: The Tier 2 session memory template should explicitly include the S6-06 parking station append instruction so that all future agents using the template inherit the correct `suggestions-log.md` append behaviour by default. This reduces the risk of agents omitting the step when producing handover artifacts.
