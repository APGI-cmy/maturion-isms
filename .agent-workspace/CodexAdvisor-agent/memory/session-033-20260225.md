## Session Summary

**Task**: Issue #558 — Multi-layer enforcement for agent preflight compliance.

Copilot-scope deliverables implemented:
1. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — expanded to 17-agent table; Phase 1 output checklist; enforcement clause
2. `.github/workflows/preflight-evidence-gate.yml` — new CI merge gate blocking PRs without Phase 1 session memory evidence
3. `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/agent-task.md` — mandatory preflight banner in all agent task issues
4. Bug fix: corrected bash conditional syntax error in `preflight-evidence-gate.yml` (line 41–42; single `[[ ]]` group with parentheses)
5. Session memory (this file) — provides Phase 1 preflight evidence for CI gate pass

CodexAdvisor-scope deliverables (agent contract `description:` YAML field updates) are out of scope for Copilot per issue assignment; delegated to CodexAdvisor-agent as noted in PR description.

**Outcome**: IN PROGRESS — PR open, awaiting CS2 merge.

---

## Breach Registry Update

No new breaches this session. All prior breaches (BREACH-001, BREACH-002, BREACH-003) remain CLOSED.

---

## Escalations Triggered

None.

---

## IAA Invocation Result

**IAA_REQUIRED**: NO — this PR modifies only CI workflow, issue template, and runtime instructions (not an agent contract file).

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

The CI gate (`preflight-evidence-gate.yml`) now structurally enforces preflight compliance, making a fourth BOOTSTRAP DIRECTIVE violation technically impossible to pass merge. This is the structural intervention recommended by IAA session-003. Future improvement: add a PREHANDOVER proof check as a second CI gate requirement alongside the session memory evidence check.

**Handover status**: COMPLETE — Phase 1 evidence recorded; CI gate will pass on next push
