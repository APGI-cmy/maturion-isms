# Session 010 - 20260216 (LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: CodexAdvisor-agent
- Class: overseer
- Session ID: session-010-20260216

## Task
**CRITICAL**: Restore and remediate Foreman agent contract file after constitutional authority violation (Issue: Restore Foreman Agent Contract)

**Context**: The governance-liaison-isms agent incorrectly created/modified `.github/agents/foreman-isms-agent.md` in PR #222, violating the constitutional rule that **ONLY CodexAdvisor can create/modify builder and foreman agent files**. This resulted in the Foreman agent disappearing from the GitHub Copilot agent list.

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
- `.github/agents/foreman-isms-agent.md` — SHA256: `283d43db43242d471ec5af4565a93ab2f4a5d9c6b0d4af33b7fec897145e8e82`

### Actions Taken

1. **Wake-Up Protocol Execution**
   - Ran `.github/scripts/wake-up-protocol.sh CodexAdvisor-agent`
   - Verified CANON_INVENTORY.json accessible (version 5, consumer mode)
   - Confirmed all health checks PASSED

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Reviewed foreman-isms-agent.md created in PR #222 by governance-liaison-isms
   - Identified **agent.id mismatch**: frontmatter declared `id: foreman-isms-agent` but agent section declared `id: foreman-isms`
   - Compared all agent files: ALL other agents have consistent IDs between frontmatter and agent.id
   - **ROOT CAUSE**: ID mismatch prevented GitHub Copilot from recognizing/registering the agent

3. **Compliance Verification**
   - Loaded `governance/checklists/FOREMAN_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Verified file content against all 7 categories (0-7) of Living Agent System v6.2.0
   - Confirmed ALL requirements satisfied:
     - Category 0: Identity & canonical bindings (including FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md)
     - Category 1: Authority & POLC boundaries
     - Category 2: Governance loading
     - Category 3: Memory & evidence (session memory MANDATORY with gate enforcement)
     - Category 4: Ripple & merge gates
     - Category 5: Escalation & stop conditions
     - Category 6: Wave gates and certification (v2.2.0 enhancements from PR #222)
     - Category 7: Prohibitions (including "Tested" ≠ "Delivered")
   - File size: 26,498 characters (well under 30,000 limit)

4. **Constitutional Correction**
   - **Changed**: `agent.id: foreman-isms` → `agent.id: foreman-isms-agent`
   - **Reasoning**: Restore ID consistency with frontmatter and filename
   - **Authority**: CodexAdvisor-agent (proper agent-factory authority)
   - **Minimal change**: Single line edit (1 insertion, 1 deletion)

### Decisions Made

1. **Decision: Fix ID mismatch rather than recreate file**
   - **Why**: File content from PR #222 is fully compliant with Living Agent System v6.2.0
   - **Why**: PR #222 correctly integrated FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md requirements
   - **Why**: Minimal surgical change aligns with agent instructions (smallest possible changes)
   - **Constitutional correction**: CodexAdvisor taking ownership via commit authorship

2. **Decision: Document as constitutional correction, not file creation**
   - **Why**: Issue was authority violation (wrong agent authored), not content deficiency
   - **Why**: ID mismatch was the technical cause of agent list disappearance
   - **Why**: Proper documentation prevents future authority confusion

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: This session memory file
- Compliance verification: All 7 categories of FOREMAN_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md satisfied
- File checksum: SHA256 verified post-modification

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple required (single-file correction, no governance changes)
- Ripple required: NO

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Constitutional authority violation corrected
- Gap addressed: Agent-factory authority boundaries now respected

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: No hygiene issues detected
- Note: Identified pattern for future prevention (see Lessons below)

## Outcome
✅ **COMPLETE**

**Success Criteria Met**:
- [x] Foreman agent contract corrected by CodexAdvisor-agent (proper authority)
- [x] Agent ID mismatch fixed (foreman-isms → foreman-isms-agent)
- [x] All PR #222 standards properly integrated and verified
- [x] File compliant with Living Agent System v6.2.0 (all 7 categories)
- [x] File size under 30,000 character limit (26,498 chars)
- [x] Constitutional correction documented
- [x] Minimal surgical change (1 line modified)

**Pending User Verification**:
- [ ] Foreman agent reappears in GitHub Copilot agent list (manual verification required)

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Wake-up protocol quickly identified environment health and governance state
- Systematic comparison of all agent files revealed ID mismatch pattern
- explore agent efficiently validated 7-category checklist compliance
- Minimal change principle: Single-line fix vs full file recreation
- Constitutional ownership correction without content disruption

### What Was Challenging
- Initial confusion between authority violation (who created) vs technical issue (ID mismatch)
- Required understanding of GitHub Copilot agent discovery mechanism (not documented in governance)
- Balancing "take ownership" instruction with "minimal change" principle

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- **Agent ID consistency is critical**: frontmatter `id`, agent `id`, and filename must align
- **GitHub Copilot agent discovery**: Relies on YAML frontmatter parsing; mismatches break registration
- **Authority correction pattern**: When wrong agent creates file, CodexAdvisor takes ownership via commit, not recreation (if content valid)
- **PR #222 gold standard**: Foreman contract v2.2.0 includes FULLY_FUNCTIONAL_DELIVERY_STANDARD.md wave gates
- **Checklist location**: Consumer repos use `governance/checklists/` (same path as canonical)

### Governance Insights
- **Agent boundary violation detection**: No automated gate caught governance-liaison creating foreman file
- **Suggested enhancement**: Add pre-commit hook validating agent file modifications by correct agent
- **Pattern for escalation**: ID mismatches in agent files → immediate CodexAdvisor involvement
- **Authority model clarity**: "Only CodexAdvisor creates agent files" is clear; enforcement mechanism is manual
