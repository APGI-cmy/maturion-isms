## Session Summary

**Task**: CS2 RCA and learning loop activation following PR #553 failures:
1. Record learning: contract was not read before starting — this is the root cause of all PR #553 failures
2. Record learning: no IAA token obtained before handover
3. Add A-013 to FAIL-ONLY-ONCE: pre-handover merge gate parity must include character count verification
4. Record BREACH-002 in breach-registry.md
5. Produce session memory and PREHANDOVER proof

**Root Cause Analysis (CS2-identified)**:
The BOOTSTRAP DIRECTIVE was not followed for CodexAdvisor's own session. Work began with repository exploration instead of reading `.github/agents/CodexAdvisor-agent.md` first and executing Phase 1. This caused:

1. Phase 2 Step 2.5 (size projection) was never run for any modified `.github/agents/*.md` file
2. Phase 3 Step 3.8 (merge gate parity check) was never run — character count check missed
3. Phase 4 Step 4.1 (OPOJD gate) was never run — character count confirmed missed
4. Phase 4 Step 4.4 (IAA invocation) was never run — no ASSURANCE-TOKEN obtained

The violation CodexAdvisor was inserting into all other agents was violated by CodexAdvisor itself in the same session. This is the most direct form of failure to apply one's own governance.

**Actions completed**:
1. Three oversized files already remediated (prior commit 9386e78):
   - `governance-liaison-isms-agent.md`: 36,581 → 28,999 chars
   - `ui-builder.md`: 30,442 → 29,873 chars
   - `CodexAdvisor-agent.md`: 30,177 → 29,996 chars
2. BREACH-002 created and closed in breach-registry.md
3. FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md v1.1.0 → v1.2.0: A-013 added (pre-handover char count verification)
4. Session memory (this file) created
5. PREHANDOVER-session-031 created
6. lessons-learned.md updated
7. Parking station updated

**Outcome**: COMPLETED
**IAA Invocation**: PHASE_A_ADVISORY — IAA not yet in Phase B; invocation logged; PR flagged for IAA review on Phase B activation. Note: formal IAA invocation (Step 4.4) was not completed before PR #553 was opened. This is a process breach. A-001 and A-002 apply. BREACH-002 records this.

## Breach Registry Update

**BREACH-002**: PR #553 — contract not read first; Model Scaling Check failure; no IAA token
- Opened: 2026-02-25 (this session)
- Root cause: BOOTSTRAP DIRECTIVE violated for CodexAdvisor's own session — contract not read before starting
- Cascading failures: Phase 2.5, 3.8, 4.1, 4.4 all skipped
- Status: CLOSED — oversized files remediated (9386e78); A-013 added; breach recorded

---

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Updates

**A-013 added** (CodexAdvisor registry v1.1.0 → v1.2.0):
Triggered by BREACH-002. Rule: Pre-handover merge gate parity MUST include explicit character count verification (`wc -c`) for every `.github/agents/*.md` modified. Any file > 30,000 chars → HALT, remediate, re-count before opening PR. Document exact counts in PREHANDOVER proof.

---

## Escalations Triggered

None. BREACH-002 was opened and closed within this session. Oversized files were already remediated in commit 9386e78 prior to this session.

---

## IAA Invocation Result

**IAA_REQUIRED**: YES (agent contracts modified in PR #553)
**IAA result**: PHASE_A_ADVISORY — formal Step 4.4 invocation was not completed before PR #553 was opened. This is a process violation captured in BREACH-002. PR is flagged for IAA review when Phase B activates.

---

## CANON_INVENTORY Status

- **Status**: VALID
- **Placeholder hashes**: NONE
- **Last verified**: 2026-02-25

---

## Permanent Rules Recorded (Learning Loop)

**A-013** (CodexAdvisor FAIL-ONLY-ONCE):
Pre-handover merge gate parity must include `wc -c` on every `.github/agents/*.md` modified. 30,000 char limit is hard. Document exact counts in PREHANDOVER proof. This is a BLOCKING check at Phase 3.8 and Phase 4.1.

**Root cause pattern recorded** (lessons-learned.md):
Contract-not-read-first is a first-order failure that disables all downstream gates. The BOOTSTRAP DIRECTIVE exists precisely to prevent this. Violating it while inserting it into other agents is the most direct demonstration of why it is needed.

---

## Next Session Notes

- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-013 is now active. Must be checked at Phase 3.8 and Phase 4.1 for every agent contract PR.
- BREACH-002 is closed. Both BREACH-001 and BREACH-002 serve as evidence that Phase 1 must be fully executed before any work begins.
- IAA invocation (Phase 4 Step 4.4) must be formally completed — not noted as advisory — before any future agent contract PR is opened.
- CS2 acknowledgment of BREACH-002 required.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

BREACH-002 reveals that the BOOTSTRAP DIRECTIVE, A-012, and all Phase 1-4 steps were not self-applied by CodexAdvisor in the same session CodexAdvisor was inserting them into other agents. This suggests a structural gap: the CodexAdvisor contract's BOOTSTRAP DIRECTIVE should reference FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-012 explicitly by ID in the YAML directive block (not just in the body), making it machine-readable. Recommendation: Add a `bootstrap_directive_ref: FAIL-ONLY-ONCE-A-012` field to the CodexAdvisor YAML `identity` block so any pre-processing layer can enforce it before session start.

**Handover status**: COMPLETE — BREACH-002 closed, A-013 added, learning loop activated per CS2 mandate
