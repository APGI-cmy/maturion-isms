# PREHANDOVER Proof — Session 024 — 2026-02-23

**Agent**: CodexAdvisor-agent
**Session**: 024
**Date**: 2026-02-23
**CS2 Authorization**: CS2 (Johan Ras) — GitHub Issue (CS2 Authorization — CodexAdvisor agent contract parking station step)
**Living Agent System**: v6.2.0

---

## Deliverable Summary

Add the Parking Station sub-step to Phase 4, step 4 of `.github/agents/CodexAdvisor-agent.md` so that CodexAdvisor inherits the `suggestions-log.md` append behaviour constitutionally. One bullet line added — no other changes to the contract file.

### Files Changed

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `.github/agents/CodexAdvisor-agent.md` | UPDATED — Parking Station bullet added as last sub-item of Phase 4 step 4 |
| `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md` | UPDATED — session-024 row appended |
| `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-024-20260223.md` | CREATED (this file) |
| `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/session-024-20260223.md` | CREATED — session memory |
