## Mode Transitions

- STANDBY → ALIGNMENT (CS2 authorization confirmed)
- ALIGNMENT → WORK (CANON_INVENTORY valid, self-modification prohibition observed)
- WORK → QP CHECK (all deliverables complete)
- QP CHECK → HANDOVER (QP PASS — all gates satisfied)

---

## QP Verdict

**PASS** — Parking Station bullet correctly worded and placed as last sub-item of Phase 4 step 4. No other changes to agent contract. Character count 9,191 within limits. No governance weakening. YAML frontmatter untouched.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY — non-blank)

1. **Add `session-memory-template.md` Parking Station step**: Now that the agent contract constitutionally requires the parking station append, the Tier 2 `session-memory-template.md` should also include an explicit Parking Station section so agents using the template automatically produce the correct `suggestions-log.md` append line. This closes the last gap between the contract mandate and the template artefact.
