## Governance Canon References

- `governance/canon/AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md` — session memory protocol
- `governance/canon/EVIDENCE_ARTIFACT_BUNDLE_STANDARD.md` — mandatory evidence bundle per PR
- Issue: "[LAS v6.2.0] Enforce all non-negotiable handover gates"

---

## Next Session Notes

- Monitor merge of this PR (copilot/enforce-handover-gates); verify all 5 gaps are resolved
- Both agent contracts (foreman-v2 and CodexAdvisor) now have explicit Phases 1/3/4 steps for all LAS v6.2.0 non-negotiable gates
- Future sessions must populate `prior_sessions_reviewed` and `unresolved_items_from_prior_sessions` in every session memory

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY — non-blank)

- The LAS v6.2.0 gap analysis identified 5 gaps that were implied but not explicitly named as steps in agent contracts. Future gap analyses should be done against a formal checklist of all required named steps, not just a narrative description, to reduce the risk of implied-but-not-enforced requirements.
