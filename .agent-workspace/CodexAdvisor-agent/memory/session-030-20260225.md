## Session Summary

**Task**: Implement governance requirements from breach issue:
1. IAA must audit PR #546 and issue a binary verdict
2. CodexAdvisor must record PR #546 as a governance/process violation
3. Update FAIL-ONLY-ONCE learning references
4. Ensure all process mistakes are caught within the PR going forward

Actions completed:
1. Created IAA session-002-20260225.md — post-merge retrospective audit of PR #546.
   - Content verdict: PASS (all 7 session-001 failures correctly resolved)
   - Process verdict: REJECTION-PACKAGE (CORE-013 IAA evidence absent, OVL-AC-006 PREHANDOVER
     absent, OVL-AC-007 session memory absent, FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-001 violated)
   - Overall: REJECTION-PACKAGE (process violations, Phase_A_advisory)
2. Updated IAA FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md v1.0.0 → v1.1.0: added A-004 rule (post-merge audit must
   produce formal breach recording in same session).
3. Updated CodexAdvisor FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md v1.0.0 → v1.1.0: added A-002 rule (IAA process
   requirements apply even when fixing IAA-identified failures; PR #546 root cause analysis).
4. Created breach-registry.md with BREACH-001 entry (AGCFPP-001-PR546): opened and closed in
   this session with all corrective actions completed.
5. Created PREHANDOVER-session-030 retroactive proof.
6. Created session-030 memory (this file).
7. Updated parking-station/suggestions-log.md with session-030 entries.

**Outcome**: COMPLETED
**IAA Verdict (PR #546)**: REJECTION-PACKAGE (process violations; content accepted)
**QP Verdict**: N/A (this is a governance recording session — no agent contract drafted)

## Escalations Triggered

None. BREACH-001 was opened and closed within this session.

---

## Blockers Encountered

None.

---

## CANON_INVENTORY Status

- **Status**: VALID
- **Placeholder hashes**: NONE
- **Last verified**: 2026-02-25

---

## IAA Invocation Result

**IAA_REQUIRED**: YES (governance recording session — IAA session-002 was the primary deliverable)
**IAA result**: REJECTION-PACKAGE (for PR #546 process violations — content accepted)
**Session-002 reference**: `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/memory/session-002-20260225.md`
**Basis**: This session's primary output IS the IAA audit (session-002). IAA invocation was the
task, not a gate on the task. The IAA verdict (REJECTION-PACKAGE for process, content accepted)
is documented and the corrective actions have been completed in this same session.

---

## Breach Registry Update

**BREACH-001**: AGCFPP-001-PR546
- Opened: 2026-02-25 (this session)
- Root cause: PR #546 submitted without IAA invocation or evidence bundle
- Status: CLOSED — all corrective actions completed this session
- Location: `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/breach-registry.md`

---

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Updates

**A-002 added** (CodexAdvisor registry v1.0.0 → v1.1.0):
Triggered by PR #546 process violation. Rule: IAA process requirements (invocation, PREHANDOVER
proof, session memory) apply unconditionally to all `.github/agents/*.md` PRs, including
those that fix IAA-identified failures. The task origin does not exempt the process requirement.

---

## Agents Created/Updated

None (governance recording session — no agent contracts created or modified).

---

## Permanent Rule Recorded (Meta-Governance Safeguard)

**Rule ID**: A-002 (CodexAdvisor FAIL-ONLY-ONCE)
**Recorded**: 2026-02-25
**Authority**: CS2 (Johan Ras) — governance breach issue (PR #546 process violation)
**Location**: `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/knowledge/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md` A-002
**Summary**: IAA invocation + PREHANDOVER proof + session memory are required for ALL agent
contract PRs. No exception for "remediation PRs" or "fix PRs". Same-day A-001 creation and A-001
violation (session-029 + PR #546) shows the rule must be enforced at PR-opening time, not just
during RAEC review.

---

## Next Session Notes

- breach-registry.md is now active. Must be loaded in Phase 1 Step 1.5 each session.
- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md A-002 is active. Must be checked at Phase 3.7 (bundle assembly) and Phase 4.4 (IAA invocation).
- Next agent contract PR must demonstrate compliance with A-001 and A-002.
- IAA session-002 REJECTION-PACKAGE is on record. CS2 acknowledgment required.

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

The root cause of PR #546's process failure is structural: FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-001 was applied to
Phase 1 preflight (load and attest) and Phase 3 IAA trigger classification, but NOT as a blocking
gate at Phase 4 Step 4.4 before PR opening. Recommendation: CodexAdvisor's Phase 4 Step 4.4
should have an explicit FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-001 check that reads: "Before opening this PR, confirm:
(a) IAA has been invoked, (b) PREHANDOVER proof is in the bundle, (c) session memory is in the
bundle. If any are missing → STOP. Do not open PR." This gate should be added to
agent-file-non-negotiables-checklist.md as S4-01 or equivalent, making it BLOCKING.
