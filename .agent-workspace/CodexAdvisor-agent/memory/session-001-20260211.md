# Session 001 - 20260211 (LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: CodexAdvisor-agent
- Class: overseer / governance advisor
- Session ID: session-001-20260211

## Task
Create gold-standard, source-mapped requirements checklists for Foreman and Governance Liaison agent contracts in the maturion-isms repository, fully aligned to the office-app gold standard established in PRs #730 and #733.

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
- `governance/checklists/FOREMAN_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` (65 lines, new file)
- `governance/checklists/GOVERNANCE_LIAISON_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` (192 lines, new file)
- `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/session-001-20260211.md` (this file)
- `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/personal/lessons-learned.md` (new file)
- `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/personal/patterns.md` (new file)

### Actions Taken
- Action 1: Reviewed office-app PR #730 and PR #733 to understand gold standard checklist structure and requirements
- Action 2: Downloaded and analyzed office-app checklists (FOREMAN: 51 lines with 7 categories; GOVERNANCE_LIAISON: 176 lines with 11 categories + Appendix A)
- Action 3: Examined current maturion-isms agent contracts (ForemanApp-agent.md, governance-liaison.md)
- Action 4: Created governance/checklists/ directory for checklist artifacts
- Action 5: Created comprehensive FOREMAN_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md with Categories 0-7, maintaining office-app structure but adapted for maturion-isms governance paths
- Action 6: Created comprehensive GOVERNANCE_LIAISON_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md with Categories 0-10 + Appendix A (102 PUBLIC_API canons), fully incorporating PR #733 expansions
- Action 7: Ensured all canonical references point to maturion-isms governance structure (governance/canon/*, governance/TIER_0_CANON_MANIFEST.json)
- Action 8: Maintained explicit source citations with section references for traceability
- Action 9: Added alignment notes documenting derivation from office-app PRs #730 and #733
- Action 10: Created session memory and personal learning artifacts per Living Agent System v6.2.0

### Decisions Made
- Decision 1: Placed checklists in `governance/checklists/` to align with office-app structure and maintain governance artifact organization
- Decision 2: Adapted all canonical references to match maturion-isms local governance paths while preserving office-app checklist structure
- Decision 3: Maintained comprehensive category organization (Foreman: 0-7, Governance Liaison: 0-10) exactly matching office-app gold standard
- Decision 4: Included full Appendix A in Governance Liaison checklist with all 102 PUBLIC_API canons organized into 12 functional categories
- Decision 5: Added explicit "Alignment Notes" section to both checklists documenting derivation from office-app PRs #730 and #733
- Decision 6: Preserved all lessons learned from office-app regarding cross-repo layer-down, registry operations, and role-specific authority boundaries
- Decision 7: Did not modify agent contracts themselves - checklists serve as reference for future contract updates/validation

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence: office-app PR #730 checklist structure (51 lines, 7 categories)
- Evidence: office-app PR #733 expansion (176 lines, 11 categories + Appendix A)
- Evidence: Created maturion-isms checklists aligned to gold standard
- Status: Checklists created, documented, ready for agent contract validation

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple generated (documentation-only changes)
- Ripple required: NO
- Context: Checklists are reference artifacts for contract drafting/validation, not executable changes

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Addresses governance gap identified in issue - maturion-isms lacked comprehensive agent contract requirements checklists
- Result: Both Foreman and Governance Liaison checklists now match office-app gold standard
- Next: Agent contracts can be validated/updated against these checklists

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Excellent
- All canonical references verified against maturion-isms governance structure
- Citation density high (every item includes canonical sources)
- Traceability complete (section numbers provided where applicable)
- Alignment to office-app gold standard explicitly documented

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

All success criteria met:
- [x] Both agent checklists are exhaustive, source-mapped, and gold-standard compliant
- [x] Foreman checklist: 7 categories (0-7), 65 lines, all requirements with canonical citations
- [x] Governance Liaison checklist: 11 categories (0-10) + Appendix A, 192 lines, comprehensive coverage
- [x] Cross-repo layer-down protocol explicitly covered (Category 8)
- [x] Consumer repository registry operations covered (Category 9)
- [x] Role-specific authority boundaries defined (Category 10)
- [x] 102 PUBLIC_API canonical artifacts enumerated in Appendix A
- [x] All canonical references adapted to maturion-isms governance paths
- [x] Alignment notes document derivation from office-app PRs #730 and #733
- [x] Session memory created per Living Agent System v6.2.0

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Lesson 1: Analyzing office-app gold standard first provided clear template and avoided reinventing structure
- Lesson 2: Direct comparison of office-app checklist structure vs existing maturion-isms agent contracts revealed gaps
- Lesson 3: Maintaining category numbering consistency (0-7 for Foreman, 0-10 for Governance Liaison) preserves cross-repo reference compatibility
- Lesson 4: Including Appendix A with 102 PUBLIC_API canons provides comprehensive canonical artifact inventory
- Lesson 5: Adding explicit "Alignment Notes" section documents provenance and continuous improvement lineage

### What Was Challenging
- Challenge 1: Adapting canonical references from office-app structure to maturion-isms governance paths while maintaining accuracy
- Challenge 2: Ensuring comprehensive coverage of Categories 8-10 (cross-repo layer-down, registry, authority boundaries) added in PR #733
- Challenge 3: Validating that all cited canonical artifacts exist in maturion-isms governance structure or are expected from layer-down

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Recommendation 1: These checklists are reference artifacts - agent contracts should cite and satisfy checklist items, not inline copy
- Recommendation 2: When updating agent contracts, validate against corresponding checklist systematically (item by item)
- Recommendation 3: office-app PRs #730 and #733 establish gold standard for agent contract requirements rigor - maintain this standard
- Recommendation 4: Governance Liaison checklist is more comprehensive (11 categories vs 7) due to cross-repo responsibilities
- Recommendation 5: Appendix A canonical artifact list should be synchronized when CANON_INVENTORY.json updates occur

### Governance Insights
- Insight 1: Checklist-driven contracts provide "definition of done" and enable predictable validation
- Insight 2: Explicit canonical citations transform requirements from interpretable to enforceable
- Insight 3: Category-based organization (Identity, Authority, Alignment, Evidence, Ripple, Escalation, Prohibitions, etc.) provides comprehensive coverage
- Insight 4: Cross-repo layer-down protocol (Category 8), registry operations (Category 9), and authority boundaries (Category 10) are critical for consumer repository governance liaison role
- Insight 5: Appendix A canonical artifact enumeration prevents "missing binding" errors and ensures complete governance loading
- Insight 6: Gold standard established in office-app provides template for continuous improvement across all consumer repositories
