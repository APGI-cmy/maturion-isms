## Next Session Notes

- Issue #566 PR awaiting CS2 review and approval
- Knowledge index v1.3.0 references contract v2.1.0 — STALE. Recommend updating knowledge index for CodexAdvisor-agent in next session

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **Pre-change size budget calculation**: The governance-liaison contract grew from 29,117 to 31,257 chars during changes before being brought back to 29,628 via targeted compression. A mandatory pre-change size budget calculation (current + estimated additions - estimated removals) before starting edits would eliminate this iterative approach. Recommend adding to Phase 2 Step 2.5 a file-specific size projection for all target files.

2. **Physical section ordering specification**: Task instructions for Phase 4 restructuring said "4.2 immediately follows the OPOJD gate" but the renumbering instructions listed session memory as 4.1→4.3, not 4.2. The physical reordering required an additional pass. Future tasks should explicitly state both the numbering AND the desired physical order of sections in the file.

3. **CodexAdvisor knowledge index staleness**: The Tier 2 knowledge index references contract version 2.1.0 but the contract is at 3.2.0 — flagged as STALE in Phase 1 Step 1.2. This should be corrected in a dedicated micro-session.
