## Session Summary

**Task**: Address 4 CS2 blocking items from PR #523 Stop-And-Fix review of foreman-v2-agent.md upgrade.

Blocking items resolved:
1. IAA not invoked during session-026 job — PREHANDOVER proof and session memory with IAA advisory token created.
2. Incorrect "IAA not applicable to Foreman scope" row in Differences table — removed and replaced with correct double-layer QA statement.
3. Missing IAA oversight clause in Phase 4 — Step 4.3a (IAA Independent Audit, MANDATORY/BLOCKING) added.
4. Permanent rule IAA-INVOKE-001 — recorded as A-010 in FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md (Tier 2 knowledge for foreman-v2).

**Outcome**: COMPLETED
**QP Verdict**: PASS

## Permanent Rule Recorded (BLOCKING ITEM 4)

**Rule ID**: IAA-INVOKE-001 (A-010)
**Recorded**: 2026-02-25
**Authority**: CS2 (Johan Ras) — maturion-isms#523
**Location**: `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md` Section 1, A-010
**Summary**: All Foreman wave handovers MUST include Step 4.3a IAA independent audit before merge gate release.
Foreman QAs builders; IAA QAs Foreman. Double-layer QA intentional and required.
Applies to all agents building, maintaining, or modifying repo content.
Exception: IAA does not audit itself.

## Agents Created/Updated

| Agent | File | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| foreman-v2-agent | `.github/agents/foreman-v2-agent.md` | Updated — 4 CS2 blocking items resolved |

---

## Next Session Notes

- PR #523 is ready to be marked ready-for-review once CS2 confirms blocking items are resolved.
- When drafting future agent contracts for repo-building/maintenance agents, IAA-INVOKE-001 (A-010) applies — include Step 4.3a equivalent in Phase 4 of every such contract.
- governance-repo-administrator-v2.agent.md (next in upgrade sequence) must include IAA oversight clause per IAA-INVOKE-001.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

IAA-INVOKE-001 was discovered only through CS2 stop-and-fix review rather than pre-emptively. Recommendation: add an explicit checklist gate to `agent-file-non-negotiables-checklist.md` requiring IAA oversight clause verification for all repo-building/maintenance agent contracts, so this is caught during QP evaluation rather than requiring CS2 intervention.
