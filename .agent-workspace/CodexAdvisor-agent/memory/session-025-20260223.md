# Session Memory — Session 025 — 2026-02-23

**Agent**: CodexAdvisor-agent (coding agent proxy)
**Session**: 025
**Date**: 2026-02-23
**CS2 Authorization**: CS2 (Johan Ras) — GitHub Issue (CS2 Authorization — Parking Station constitutional standard, follow-up to PR #423)
**Living Agent System**: v6.2.0

## Session Preamble

`prior_sessions_reviewed: [021, 022, 023, 024]`
`unresolved_items_from_prior_sessions: none`

No open escalations or blockers carried from prior sessions. Session 024 suggestion (add Parking Station to session-memory-template.md) is noted but out of scope for this CS2-authorized PR.

---

## Session Objective

Propagate the Parking Station constitutional sub-step established in PR #423 to the 6 remaining in-scope agent contract files: `foreman-v2-agent.md`, `governance-liaison-isms-agent.md`, `api-builder.md`, `ui-builder.md`, `schema-builder.md`, `qa-builder.md`. Self-modification prohibition enforced — changes made by coding agent only.

## Mode Transitions

- STANDBY → ALIGNMENT (CS2 authorization confirmed)
- ALIGNMENT → WORK (CANON_INVENTORY valid, self-modification prohibition observed)
- WORK → QP CHECK (all deliverables complete)
- QP CHECK → HANDOVER (QP PASS — all gates satisfied)

---

## QP Verdict

**PASS** — Parking Station bullet correctly worded and placed as last sub-item of the session memory step in Phase 4 for all 6 files. No other changes made. All character counts under 30,000. No governance weakening. YAML frontmatter untouched on all files. Self-modification prohibition respected.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY — non-blank)

1. **Standardise builder Phase 4 session memory with explicit Suggestions for Improvement mandate**: The four builder contracts (`api-builder.md`, `ui-builder.md`, `schema-builder.md`, `qa-builder.md`) currently rely on the 4.3 Mandatory Process Improvement Reflection section for improvement capture, but lack an explicit `## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY — non-blank)` bullet in the 4.2 session memory step itself (as foreman-v2 and CodexAdvisor have). A future CS2-authorized change should add this explicit mandate to builder 4.2 sections to close the gap and ensure the parking station append is always backed by a named, non-blank improvement record.
