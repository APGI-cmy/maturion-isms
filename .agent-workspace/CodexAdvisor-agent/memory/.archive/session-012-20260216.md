# Session 012 - 20260216 (LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: CodexAdvisor-agent
- Class: overseer
- Session ID: session-012-20260216

## Task
Record CS2 governance clarification regarding agent file modification authority boundaries. Document that only CodexAdvisor-agent (via agent-factory protocol) may modify `.github/agents/**` files, except when CS2/CS1-approved issues explicitly authorize other agents. This governance learning stems from PR #233 (builder agent contract updates for Copilot discovery).

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
1. `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/session-012-20260216.md` - Created (this file)
2. `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/personal/lessons-learned.md` - Updated with authority boundary lesson
3. `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/personal/patterns.md` - Updated with agent file modification authority pattern

**SHA256 Checksums**: Pending commit

### Actions Taken

1. **Reviewed Issue Context**:
   - Analyzed Issue description regarding PR #233 (builder agent contract updates)
   - Confirmed PR #233 was correctly executed by CodexAdvisor-agent (agent-factory protocol)
   - Verified changes were technical structure only (no semantic/permission changes)
   - Confirmed this is a governance learning/clarification, not a violation

2. **Reviewed Existing Session Memory**:
   - Examined session-011-20260216.md (PR #233 builder agent updates)
   - Reviewed sessions 005-008 to understand historical agent file modifications
   - Confirmed CodexAdvisor-agent has consistently been the only agent modifying `.github/agents/**`

3. **Created Session Memory Documentation**:
   - Created session-012-20260216.md recording the governance clarification
   - Followed LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM v6.2.0 template structure
   - Documented the authority boundary rule explicitly

4. **Updated Personal Learning Files**:
   - Added lesson to lessons-learned.md: "Agent File Modification Authority Boundary"
   - Added pattern to patterns.md: "Agent File Modification Authority Protocol"
   - Ensured future sessions will reference this governance learning

### Decisions Made

1. **Decision: Record as Governance Learning, Not Violation**
   - **Rationale**: PR #233 was correctly executed by CodexAdvisor-agent; this is proactive governance clarification
   - **Authority**: CS2 Governance Ruling (2026-02-16)

2. **Decision: Create Session Memory (Session 012)**
   - **Rationale**: Document governance learning for future session reference
   - **Authority**: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0 Session Memory Protocol

3. **Decision: Update Personal Learning Files**
   - **Rationale**: Ensure authority boundary is captured in both session-specific and cumulative learning
   - **Authority**: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0 Personal Learning Updates Protocol

4. **Decision: No Additional File Edits Required**
   - **Rationale**: Issue explicitly states "No further issue creation or file edits are needed at this stage"
   - **Authority**: Issue acceptance criteria

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- **Evidence log**: Session memory file (this file) + personal learning updates
- **Status**: Complete (no code changes required, documentation-only task)

### Ripple Status
- **Status**: No ripple required (local governance learning, no constitutional changes)
- **Ripple required**: NO

### Governance Gap Progress
- **Status**: No governance gaps detected. This is proactive governance clarification, not gap remediation.

### Governance Hygiene
- **Status**: All agent file modifications follow correct authority model (CodexAdvisor-agent via agent-factory protocol)
- **Alignment**: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM v6.2.0 agent-factory protocol, AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md
- **Authority**: CS2 Governance Ruling (2026-02-16)

## Outcome

✅ **COMPLETE**

**Success Metrics**:
- Session memory file created following LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM v6.2.0 template
- Personal learning files updated with authority boundary lesson and pattern
- Future sessions will reference this governance clarification before any `.github/agents/**` modifications
- Governance learning documented for audit trail and continuous improvement

**Governance Clarification Recorded**:
- **Rule**: Only CodexAdvisor-agent (via agent-factory protocol) may modify `.github/agents/**` files
- **Exception**: CS2/CS1-approved issues may explicitly authorize other agents
- **Rationale**: Agent contracts are constitutional governance artifacts requiring agent-factory oversight
- **Authority**: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0, AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md, CS2 Governance Ruling (2026-02-16)

## Lessons

### What Worked Well

1. **Clear CS2 Governance Ruling**: Issue provided explicit context, rationale, and authority for governance clarification
2. **Proactive Governance Learning**: Recording clarification before violations occur prevents future boundary issues
3. **Session Memory Protocol**: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM v6.2.0 template structure provides consistent, comprehensive documentation
4. **Personal Learning Integration**: Cumulative lessons-learned.md and patterns.md ensure continuity across sessions

### What Was Challenging

1. **Distinguishing Learning from Violation**: Had to carefully parse that PR #233 was correct (not a violation) and this is proactive clarification
2. **Ensuring Completeness**: Needed to update both session-specific memory AND personal learning files for full coverage
3. **Authority Citation**: Required explicit citation of multiple authority sources (LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md, AGENT_CONTRACT_MANAGEMENT_PROTOCOL.md, CS2 ruling)

### What Future Sessions Should Know

1. **Agent File Modification Authority is Exclusive**: Only CodexAdvisor-agent modifies `.github/agents/**` unless CS2/CS1 issue explicitly authorizes otherwise
2. **Session Memory is Required**: Every session must create session memory file recording decisions, actions, and lessons learned
3. **Personal Learning is Cumulative**: lessons-learned.md and patterns.md accumulate knowledge across sessions for long-term reference
4. **Governance Clarifications Prevent Violations**: Proactive documentation like this prevents boundary violations before they occur
5. **Authority Boundaries Must Be Explicit**: Future agent file modifications must reference this session memory and confirm CodexAdvisor-agent authority

### Governance Insights

1. **Agent-Factory Protocol Enforcement**: CodexAdvisor-agent is the only agent authorized to create/modify agent contracts (`.github/agents/**`)
2. **Constitutional Artifact Protection**: Agent contracts are constitutional governance artifacts requiring specialized oversight
3. **Exception Model**: CS2/CS1-approved issues may grant temporary authority to other agents for specific agent file modifications
4. **Audit Trail Requirement**: All agent file modifications must be traceable to CodexAdvisor-agent git history OR explicit CS2/CS1 issue authorization
5. **Proactive Governance**: Recording authority boundaries prevents violations rather than correcting them post-facto
