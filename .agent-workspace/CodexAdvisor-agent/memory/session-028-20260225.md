## Session Summary

**Task**: Address 5 CS2 review observations on the IAA canonical contract PR (issue #533).

Observations resolved:
1. Fix false citation `maturion-isms#529` in FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-003 — replaced with correct reference to maturion-isms#528 and general IAA canon principle.
2. Tier 2 STUB checklists — no change needed; acceptable for Phase A advisory mode. CS2 awareness noted.
3. Add `phase_b_activation_condition` field to IAA contract YAML `adoption_phase` block.
4. Rename `lock_id: SELF-MOD-001` → `SELF-MOD-IAA-001` in IAA contract (YAML identity, prohibitions block, footer).
5. Create missing PREHANDOVER proof (this file's companion) and session memory (this file).

**Outcome**: COMPLETED
**QP Verdict**: PASS

## Next Session Notes

- This PR (canonical IAA contract) is ready for CS2 review and merge.
- When drafting future IAA-adjacent contracts, use `SELF-MOD-IAA-001` as the IAA lock ID reference.
- Phase B activation will require a separate CS2-authorized governance session to populate Tier 2 stub files from INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md.

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

The false citation in A-003 (`maturion-isms#529`) was introduced during initial drafting without verifying the issue number existed. Recommendation: add a pre-commit verification step to FAIL-ONLY-ONCE entries that checks all `maturion-isms#NNN` references are valid (or clearly flagged as to-be-verified). This prevents phantom issue citations from becoming permanent record in governance rules.
