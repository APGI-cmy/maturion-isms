# Session 015 - 20260217 (LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: CodexAdvisor-agent
- Class: overseer
- Session ID: session-015-20260217
- Contract Version: 6.2.0

## Task
Align Governance Liaison agent contract to Living Agent System v6.2.0 canonical requirements with four-phase architecture (Preflight-Induction-Build-Handover), RAEC behavioral examples, self-modification prohibition, and comprehensive checklist compliance.

## What I Did

### Files Modified
- `.github/agents/governance-liaison-isms-agent.md` (SHA256: c4a9bac6bf4a193b9730d863c0511afed9fc28ef33dd6a2ccca8e1a8aa6426a3)
  - Contract version: 2.0.0 → 3.0.0
  - Character count: 28,974 → 29,673 (within 30K limit, 1.1% buffer)
  - Pattern: Added `contract_pattern: four_phase_canonical`
  
- `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` (updated)
  - Added governance-liaison-isms-agent.md entry
  - Type: agent_contract
  - Layer down status: CONSUMER_SPECIFIC
  - Contract pattern: four_phase_canonical

### Actions Taken

1. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Reviewed existing governance liaison contract (28,974 chars)
   - Reviewed 72-item checklist (GOVERNANCE_LIAISON_AGENT_CONTRACT_REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md)
   - Studied foreman and builder contract patterns for four-phase architecture
   - Identified 5 required canonical documents with SHA256 hashes

2. **Contract Refactoring**:
   - **PHASE 1: PREFLIGHT** - Identity & Constitutional Constraints
     - 1.1 Identity & Authority (RAEC model, unique self-alignment authority)
     - 1.2 Sandbox & Constitutional Constraints (self-modification prohibition)
     - 1.3 Canonical Governance Bindings (5 required documents with SHA256)
   
   - **PHASE 2: INDUCTION** - Dynamic Governance Loading
     - 2.1 Session Wake-Up Protocol (reference to .github/scripts/wake-up-protocol.sh)
     - 2.2 Memory Load (session memories, personal learning, escalations)
     - 2.3 Governance State Verification (CANON_INVENTORY, SHA256 validation)
   
   - **PHASE 3: BUILD** - Governance Synchronization Execution
     - 3.1 Cross-Repository Layer-Down Protocol (CA_H priority)
     - 3.2 Governance Ripple Processing (event validation, registry checks)
     - 3.3 Drift Detection & Remediation (hourly fallback)
     - 3.4 Consumer Repository Operations (prohibitions and capabilities)
   
   - **PHASE 4: HANDOVER** - Session Closure & Evidence
     - 4.1 Session Memory Protocol (reference to session-closure.sh)
     - 4.2 Evidence Artifact Bundle (HANDOVER_SUMMARY, ALIGNMENT_EVIDENCE)
     - 4.3 Escalation Documentation (BLOCKER, GOVERNANCE_GAP, AUTHORITY_BOUNDARY)

3. **RAEC Behavioral Examples Added**:
   - ❌ WRONG vs ✅ CORRECT examples for delegation
   - Authority boundary violation examples (liaison does not write code)
   - Drift remediation examples (self-align before proceeding)
   - Ripple handling examples (validate sender, execute layer-down)

4. **Canonical Document References**:
   - AGENT_CONTRACT_ARCHITECTURE.md (SHA256: 6077885d...)
   - AGENT_PREFLIGHT_PATTERN.md (SHA256: 611ddfd8...)
   - AGENT_PRIORITY_SYSTEM.md (SHA256: d6251a95...)
   - AGENT_INDUCTION_PROTOCOL.md (SHA256: 756f6c64...)
   - AGENT_HANDOVER_AUTOMATION.md (SHA256: d5fcd80e...)

5. **Checklist Compliance**:
   - All 72 checklist items satisfied (Categories 0-10)
   - Consumer repository prohibitions enforced
   - Self-modification prohibition (LOCKED section)
   - Layer-down and ripple protocols comprehensive
   - Registry operations fully specified

### Decisions Made

1. **Contract Structure**: Adopted four-phase canonical architecture identical to foreman and builder patterns for consistency across agent contracts

2. **Character Count Management**: Used compact references instead of embedding full templates (29,673 chars vs 30,000 limit = 1.1% buffer)

3. **RAEC Model Emphasis**: Added explicit behavioral examples showing Review-Advise-Escalate-Coordinate pattern vs traditional coding agent behavior

4. **Self-Modification Prohibition**: Included LOCKED section explicitly prohibiting governance liaison from modifying own contract (enforcement via pre-execution check, merge gate validation)

5. **Consumer Repository Mode**: Emphasized read-only governance consumption, prohibited canon authoring, ripple dispatch only from canonical source

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Contract character count: 29,673 (within 30K limit)
- Checklist compliance: 72/72 items ✅
- Canonical references: 5 required documents with SHA256 hashes
- RAEC behavioral examples: 3 major scenarios covered
- Status: COMPLETE

### Ripple Status
- Status: Not applicable (agent contract upgrade, not governance propagation)
- Ripple required: NO (local contract alignment)

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: All identified gaps addressed
- Gap: Missing four-phase architecture → RESOLVED
- Gap: Missing RAEC behavioral examples → RESOLVED
- Gap: Missing explicit self-modification prohibition → RESOLVED
- Gap: Missing 5 canonical document references → RESOLVED

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: CLEAN
- CANON_INVENTORY.json updated with new contract metadata
- Character count validated (<30K GitHub UI selectability requirement)
- SHA256 checksums calculated and recorded
- Contract pattern metadata added

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Four-phase architecture template from foreman and builder contracts provided excellent pattern to follow
- RAEC behavioral examples effectively demonstrate liaison-specific authority boundaries
- Compact reference approach (vs embedding) kept character count well under 30K limit
- Checklist-driven approach ensured no requirements missed

### What Was Challenging
- Balancing comprehensive coverage with character count constraints required careful editing
- Organizing 72 checklist requirements into coherent phase structure required multiple iterations
- Ensuring all RAEC behavioral examples aligned with actual liaison authority boundaries

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Four-phase architecture is now standard for all agent contracts (Preflight-Induction-Build-Handover)
- RAEC model (Review-Advise-Escalate-Coordinate) is canonical for liaison and overseer agents
- Self-modification prohibition must be explicit LOCKED section in all agent contracts
- Character count <30K is BLOCKING requirement for GitHub UI selectability
- All agent contracts must reference 5 canonical documents with SHA256 hashes

### Governance Insights
- Consumer repository mode creates clear separation: canonical source authors, consumers receive
- Governance liaison unique self-alignment authority enables autonomous drift remediation within bounds
- RAEC behavioral examples are critical for LLM agents to override default "write code immediately" behavior
- Four-phase architecture creates consistent mental model across all agent classes
- Explicit authority boundaries (NOT builder, NOT FM, NOT enforcement) prevent scope creep
