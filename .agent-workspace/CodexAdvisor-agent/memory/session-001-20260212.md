# Session 001 - 20260212 (LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM v6.2.0)

## Agent
- Type: CodexAdvisor-agent
- Class: overseer
- Session ID: fix-governance-liaison-isms-file

## Task
Fix governance-liaison-isms-agent.md file that exceeded 30KB limit (47KB) and was not appearing in custom agent list. Reduce to under 30KB while maintaining all functionality.

## What I Did

### Files Modified (Auto-populated)
- `.github/agents/governance-liaison-isms-agent.md`
  - Original: 47,687 bytes, 1,184 lines
  - Final: 15,554 bytes, 302 lines
  - SHA256: (will be computed by git)

### Actions Taken
1. Analyzed file structure and identified bloat sources
2. Removed Appendix A (100-line exhaustive canon list) - saved ~6KB
3. Compressed YAML frontmatter (simplified bindings, reduced prohibitions) - saved ~3KB
4. Compressed categories 0-10 (verbose prose → concise bullets) - saved ~8KB
5. Compressed LOCKED sections (removed inline bash scripts) - saved ~10KB
6. Compressed session memory templates - saved ~5KB
7. Verified file structure, YAML validity, and completeness

### Decisions Made
1. **Minimalism over verbosity**: Applied minimalism principle - prefer canonical references over inline duplication
2. **Gold standard alignment**: Followed patterns from CodexAdvisor-agent.md, foreman-isms-agent.md, api-builder.md
3. **Preservation strategy**: Maintained all 10 categories, 3 LOCKED sections, canonical references, and YAML frontmatter structure
4. **Target margin**: Aimed for 25KB target (83% of limit) to allow future growth; achieved 15.5KB (52% of limit)

## Living Agent System v6.2.0 Evidence

### Evidence Collection
- Evidence log: N/A (no executable changes)
- Status: Complete

### Ripple Status
- Status: No ripple required (agent contract modification in consumer repo)
- Ripple required: NO

### Governance Gap Progress
- Status: Addressed file size gap (agent not recognized due to size)
- Gap: Agent file exceeded 30KB limit per .agent.schema.md Section 6

### Governance Hygiene
- Status: Improved governance hygiene by applying minimalism principle
- Detected: Excessive inline content violating minimalism principle

## Outcome
✅ COMPLETE

All acceptance criteria met:
- Agent file ≤ 30,000 characters (15,554 bytes ✓)
- All 10 checklist categories covered ✓
- LOCKED sections present and concise ✓
- No appendices or inline scripts ✓
- Canonical references preferred ✓

## Lessons

### What Worked Well
- Systematic phase-by-phase approach (Appendix → YAML → Categories → LOCKED → Templates)
- Measuring progress after each phase to track reduction
- Maintaining structure while compressing content
- Using gold standard examples as reference (CodexAdvisor-agent, foreman-isms-agent)

### What Was Challenging
- Balancing compression with maintaining essential information
- Identifying what was truly essential vs. redundant
- Preserving LOCKED section authority while removing inline bash scripts
- Ensuring YAML frontmatter remained valid after simplification

### What Future Sessions Should Know
- Agent files have 30KB hard limit per .agent.schema.md Section 6
- Minimalism principle: prefer canonical references over inline content
- LOCKED sections need Lock ID and Authority but can be compressed
- YAML bindings can be simplified to path-only format (no need for id/role)
- Session memory templates should reference canonical sources, not inline

### Governance Insights
- File size limits are enforced at GitHub/Copilot platform level
- Agent not appearing in list is symptom of file size violation
- Gold standard patterns exist and should be followed (CodexAdvisor-agent.md as reference)
- Minimalism principle is constitutional requirement, not optional
- Canonical references reduce duplication and file size
