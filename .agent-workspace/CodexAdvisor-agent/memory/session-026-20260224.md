# Session Memory — Session 026 — 2026-02-24

**Agent**: CodexAdvisor-agent (coding agent proxy)
**Session**: 026
**Date**: 2026-02-24
**CS2 Authorization**: CS2 (Johan Ras / @APGI-cmy) — Issue #1201 (Create IAA agent file: independent-assurance-agent.md). Authority basis: Issue opened by CS2 directly; Issue #1199 (IAA governance canon) and PR #1200 (canon merged) cited.
**Living Agent System**: v6.2.0

---

## Session Preamble

`prior_sessions_reviewed: [021, 022, 023, 024, 025]`
`unresolved_items_from_prior_sessions: none`

No open escalations or blockers carried from prior sessions. Session 025 suggestion (standardise builder Phase 4 session memory) remains a future CS2-authorized change — out of scope for this session.

---

## Session Objective

Create the Independent Assurance Agent (IAA) Tier 1 contract file (`.github/agents/independent-assurance-agent.md`) and Tier 2 knowledge stub, as required by Issue #1201 and the IAA governance canon merged via PR #1200.

## Actions Taken

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Reviewed sessions 021–025 for unresolved items | DONE — none carried forward |
| 2 | Explored repository structure, existing agent files, CodexAdvisor Tier 2 knowledge | DONE |
| 3 | Drafted `independent-assurance-agent.md` — four-phase, QP-compliant, 16,213 chars | DONE |
| 4 | QP evaluation — 33/33 gates PASS | DONE — QP VERDICT: PASS |
| 5 | Created `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/knowledge/index.md` Tier 2 stub | DONE |
| 6 | Created `PREHANDOVER-session-026-20260224.md` | DONE |
| 7 | Created `session-026-20260224.md` (this file) | DONE |
| 8 | Appended session-026 row to `suggestions-log.md` | DONE |
| 9 | IAA adoption phase PHASE_A_ADVISORY — invocation logged, proceeding advisory | DONE |

---

## Mode Transitions

- STANDBY → ALIGNMENT (CS2 authorization confirmed via Issue #1201)
- ALIGNMENT → WORK (CANON_INVENTORY valid, self-modification prohibition observed, target is not CodexAdvisor-agent.md)
- WORK → QP CHECK (IAA contract draft complete, Tier 2 stub complete)
- QP CHECK → HANDOVER (QP PASS — 33/33 gates)

---

## QP Verdict

**PASS** — 33/33 gates across S1–S6. Character count 16,213 (well under target). Binary verdict design correct. Independence requirement encoded in both YAML and Phase 1/2. All prohibitions present with id, rule, enforcement. Session memory and parking station mandated in Phase 4. No Tier 2 content embedded. All structural rules satisfied.

---

## Agents Created or Updated

- `independent-assurance-agent` (CREATED)

---

## Escalations Triggered

None.

---

## IAA Invocation Result

**PHASE_A_ADVISORY** — IAA canon live but IAA not yet deployed as an active agent. This PR (new IAA agent contract creation) triggers IAA per the trigger table. Invocation logged. Proceeding under advisory mode. Flagged for IAA review once Phase B activates.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY — non-blank)

1. **Populate IAA Tier 2 stubs from IAA canon**: The four stub files referenced in `iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md`, `iaa-trigger-table.md`, `iaa-category-overlays.md`, and `session-memory-template.md` need to be populated from `governance/canon/INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md` in a follow-on CS2-authorized session. Until populated, IAA Phase 3 checks reference stubs rather than full checklists. This is acceptable for Phase A (advisory) but must be resolved before Phase B (blocking) activation.

2. **No degradation observed**: Core contract structure, four-phase canonical pattern, binary verdict design, and independence enforcement are all well-formed and consistent with existing agent files in the system.

---

## Parking Station

| 2026-02-24 | CodexAdvisor-agent | session-026 | Populate IAA Tier 2 stubs (iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md, iaa-trigger-table.md, iaa-category-overlays.md, session-memory-template.md) from INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md before Phase B activation | `session-026-20260224.md` |
