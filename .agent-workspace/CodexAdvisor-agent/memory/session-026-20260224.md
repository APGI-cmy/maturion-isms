# Session Memory — Session 026 — 2026-02-24

**Agent**: CodexAdvisor-agent (coding agent proxy)
**Session**: 026
**Date**: 2026-02-24
**CS2 Authorization**: CS2 (Johan Ras / @APGI-cmy) — Issue #1201 (Create IAA agent file: independent-assurance-agent.md). Authority basis: Issue opened by CS2 directly; Issue #1199 (IAA governance canon) and PR #1200 (canon merged) cited.
**Living Agent System**: v6.2.0

---

## Session Preamble

`prior_sessions_reviewed: [021, 022, 023, 024, 025]`
`unresolved_items_from_prior_sessions: none`

No open escalations or blockers carried from prior sessions. Session 025 suggestion (standardise builder Phase 4 session memory) remains a future CS2-authorized change — out of scope for this session.

---

## Session Objective

Create the Independent Assurance Agent (IAA) Tier 1 contract file (`.github/agents/independent-assurance-agent.md`) and Tier 2 knowledge stub, as required by Issue #1201 and the IAA governance canon merged via PR #1200.

## Actions Taken

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Reviewed sessions 021–025 for unresolved items | DONE — none carried forward |
| 2 | Explored repository structure, existing agent files, CodexAdvisor Tier 2 knowledge | DONE |
| 3 | Drafted `independent-assurance-agent.md` — four-phase, QP-compliant, 16,213 chars | DONE |
| 4 | QP evaluation — 33/33 gates PASS | DONE — QP VERDICT: PASS |
| 5 | Created `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/knowledge/index.md` Tier 2 stub | DONE |
| 6 | Created `PREHANDOVER-session-026-20260224.md` | DONE |
| 7 | Created `session-026-20260224.md` (this file) | DONE |
| 8 | Appended session-026 row to `suggestions-log.md` | DONE |
| 9 | IAA adoption phase PHASE_A_ADVISORY — invocation logged, proceeding advisory | DONE |
| 10 | CS2 issued REJECTION-PACKAGE (3 findings) — addressed all findings in same session | DONE |
| 11 | Finding 1: `secret: "MATURION_BOT_TOKEN"` → `secret_env_var: MATURION_BOT_TOKEN` | FIXED |
| 12 | Finding 2: Added Step 1.5 (breach registry), renumbered 1.5→1.6, 1.6→1.7 | FIXED |
| 13 | Finding 3: Added `governance.version: v6.2.0` to YAML frontmatter | FIXED |
| 14 | QP re-run post-fix — all gates PASS | DONE — QP VERDICT: PASS |
| 15 | Updated PREHANDOVER proof to reflect fixes and new char count (16,667) | DONE |
| 16 | Fixed `governance/sync_state.json` — removed unresolved git merge conflict markers (invalid JSON) | FIXED |
| 17 | Verified `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` — clean, no action required | CONFIRMED |

---

## Mode Transitions

- STANDBY → ALIGNMENT (CS2 authorization confirmed via Issue #1201)
- ALIGNMENT → WORK (CANON_INVENTORY valid, self-modification prohibition observed, target is not CodexAdvisor-agent.md)
- WORK → QP CHECK (IAA contract draft complete, Tier 2 stub complete)
- QP CHECK → HANDOVER (QP PASS — 33/33 gates)

---

## QP Verdict

**PASS (v2 — post REJECTION-PACKAGE fixes)** — All 3 CS2 findings resolved. Character count 16,667 (well under target). All YAML fields correct. `governance.version: v6.2.0` added. `secret_env_var` pattern used (no secrets scanner trigger). Step 1.5 breach registry added, steps renumbered correctly. Binary verdict design correct. Independence requirement encoded. All prohibitions present. Session memory and parking station mandated in Phase 4. No Tier 2 content embedded.

---

## Agents Created or Updated

- `independent-assurance-agent` (CREATED)

---

## Escalations Triggered

None.

**Learning — Merge Gate CI Failure (job 64703977203):**
`governance/sync_state.json` contained unresolved git merge conflict markers (from a ripple/layer-down merge into main that was never fully resolved). The conflict markers are invalid JSON syntax, which caused the `Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment` check to fail with exit code 1. Fix: removed conflict markers by resolving to the ripple/layer-down version (later timestamp, representing the most recent governance sync). Prevention: always validate all governance JSON files locally (`python3 -c "import json; json.load(open(...))"`) before handover. Canon update incoming (`maturion-foreman-governance#1201`) will formalise this as a mandatory pre-handover parity check.

---

## IAA Invocation Result

**PHASE_A_ADVISORY** — IAA canon live but IAA not yet deployed as an active agent. This PR (new IAA agent contract creation) triggers IAA per the trigger table. Invocation logged. CS2 issued REJECTION-PACKAGE with 3 findings; all findings resolved in same session. Proceeding under advisory mode. Flagged for IAA review once Phase B activates.

---

## REJECTION-PACKAGE Resolution Record

CS2 issued REJECTION-PACKAGE via PR comment. All 3 findings resolved:

| Finding | Description | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| FINDING 1 | `secret: "MATURION_BOT_TOKEN"` triggers secrets scanner | Changed to `secret_env_var: MATURION_BOT_TOKEN` |
| FINDING 2 | Breach registry step missing from Phase 1 | Added Step 1.5 (breach registry); renumbered 1.5→1.6, 1.6→1.7 |
| FINDING 3 | `governance.version` field missing from YAML | Added `version: v6.2.0` as second line of governance block |

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY — non-blank)

1. **Populate IAA Tier 2 stubs from IAA canon**: The four stub files referenced in `iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md`, `iaa-trigger-table.md`, `iaa-category-overlays.md`, and `session-memory-template.md` need to be populated from `governance/canon/INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md` in a follow-on CS2-authorized session. Until populated, IAA Phase 3 checks reference stubs rather than full checklists. This is acceptable for Phase A (advisory) but must be resolved before Phase B (blocking) activation.

2. **No degradation observed**: Core contract structure, four-phase canonical pattern, binary verdict design, and independence enforcement are all well-formed and consistent with existing agent files in the system.

## Parking Station

| 2026-02-24 | CodexAdvisor-agent | session-026 | Populate IAA Tier 2 stubs (iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md, iaa-trigger-table.md, iaa-category-overlays.md, session-memory-template.md) from INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md before Phase B activation | `session-026-20260224.md` |
| 2026-02-24 | independent-assurance-agent | session-026 | SESSION-END | Merge gate failed on invalid sync_state.json JSON syntax (unresolved git conflict markers) — canon update #1201 incoming to enforce local parity checks pre-handover. | `session-026-20260224.md` |
