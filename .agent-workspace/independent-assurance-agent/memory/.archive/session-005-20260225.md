## Invocation Metadata

**pr_reviewed**: PR #565 — "Governance hardening: CI enforcement for PREHANDOVER proof, ui-builder char limit, builder YAML attestation standard, and FetchFn adapter pattern"
**invoking_agent**: CodexAdvisor-agent (session-035 retroactive invocation — PR opened without prior IAA invocation)
**producing_agent**: CodexAdvisor-agent (acting via GitHub Copilot Coding Agent; governance artifacts created/modified)
**producing_agent_class**: overseer (CodexAdvisor class)
**pr_category**: GOVERNANCE (no agent contracts modified — governance templates and builder knowledge indexes only)
**ambiguity_rule_applied**: NO — no `.github/agents/*.md` files in diff; governance template category
**invocation_type**: RETROACTIVE — PR was opened without IAA invocation. This session is the retroactive invocation triggered by CS2 stop-and-fix feedback: "You did not read your own agent file, again. Therefore the merge gate will fail."

## Content Audit

### CI Workflow (governance-hardening.yml)

**YAML syntax**: PASS — valid YAML confirmed  
**Job 1: prehandover-proof-presence**: Logic is correct. Scopes to `.github/agents/*.md` and `governance/aimc/AIMC_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT_WAVE_PLAN.md`. Includes bypass for automated governance alignment PRs. Checks both diff-added files and existing repo artifacts. Error messages are actionable.  
**Job 2: ui-builder-character-count**: Logic is correct. Checks `wc -c` against 30,000 limit. Warning threshold at 29,000. Error messages reference constitutional limit and remediation steps correctly.

**Content verdict**: PASS

### BUILDER_PREFLIGHT_YAML_STANDARD.md

Canonical YAML block matches the pattern used by qa-builder (session-wave7-red-20260226.md) — the compliant reference implementation. Field definitions are complete. Migration guidance is appropriate (grandfathers prior sessions, requires YAML from publication date forward). No gaps found.

**Content verdict**: PASS

### ADAPTER_ARCHITECTURE.md

FetchFn export requirement is correctly codified. Non-negotiable checklist is specific and actionable. Contract test integration guidance matches actual `ProviderAdapter.contract.test.ts` structure. All 4 existing adapters confirmed as conforming.

**Content verdict**: PASS

### DELEGATION_PROTOCOL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (v1.1.0)

Non-negotiable requirements section correctly references all 4 policies, their CI enforcement locations, and their canonical documentation. Version bumped from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 appropriately.

**Content verdict**: PASS

### Builder Knowledge Index Updates

All 5 updated indexes correctly reference the YAML standard. The ui-builder index additionally documents the character count CI gate. No Tier 2 content violations. No version inconsistencies.

**Content verdict**: PASS
