## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

- fail_only_once_rules_applied:
  - A-001 (IAA invocation evidence for AGENT_CONTRACT): N/A — CANON_GOVERNANCE. CORE-013 handles. PASS.
  - A-002 (no class exceptions): CONFIRMED — foreman invoked IAA; no exemption claimed. PASS.
  - A-003 (ambiguity resolves to mandatory): N/A — category unambiguous. PASS.
  - A-004 (bootstrap first): ATTESTED. PASS.
  - A-005 (no .github/agents/ modifications): CONFIRMED — zero .github/agents/ in diff. PASS.
  - A-006 (PHASE_A_ADVISORY FABRICATION detection): Token `IAA-session-018-20260228-PASS` does NOT match PHASE_A_ADVISORY pattern. A-006 not triggered. However CORE-016 addressed the incorrect PASS claim separately. PASS (A-006 not triggered).

- fail_only_once_updates: NONE — CORE-016 partial-fix pattern already recognized in session-018 learning notes.

## Core Invariants Detail

| Check | Verdict | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| CORE-005 | PASS ✅ | CANON_INVENTORY valid, 188 canons, 0 bad hashes |
| CORE-006 | PASS ✅ | SHA256 independently verified: de6736... exact match |
| CORE-007 | PASS ✅ | No active placeholder content. "STUB" appears only in version history entries (acceptable). Template instruction text in prehandover-template.md is intentional. |
| CORE-013 | PASS ✅ | PREHANDOVER proof file exists — remediation from session-018 CORE-013 failure |
| CORE-014 | PASS ✅ | No class exemption claimed |
| CORE-015 | PASS ✅ | Session memory file exists — remediation from session-018 CORE-015 failure |
| CORE-016 | FAIL ❌ | (A) iaa_audit_token: IAA-session-018-20260228-PASS incorrect — session-018 was REJECTION (IAA-018-20260228-REJECT). (B) ## IAA Agent Response (verbatim) section contains [Pending...] + Foreman summary — NOT verbatim IAA output. Fix instruction "paste verbatim" from session-018 was not followed. |
| CORE-017 | PASS ✅ | Zero .github/agents/ modifications |

## Category Overlay Detail (CANON_GOVERNANCE)

| Check | Verdict | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| OVL-CG-001 | PASS ✅ | CANON_INVENTORY updated: hash + version 1.1.0 |
| OVL-CG-002 | PASS ✅ | No placeholder hashes; SHA256 independently verified |
| OVL-CG-003 | PASS ✅ | IAA canon bumped 1.0.0→1.1.0; all Tier 2 files also bumped |
| OVL-CG-004 | PASS ✅ | Ripple addressed: D4 foreman template created |

## Merge Gate Parity Detail

1. **Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict** — LOCAL: FAIL ❌
   - CORE-016 failure: iaa_audit_token incorrect + verbatim section unfilled

2. **Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment** — LOCAL: FAIL ❌
   - CANON_INVENTORY valid ✅, SHA256 verified ✅, content correct ✅
   - Bundle integrity: CORE-016 violation ❌

3. **Merge Gate Interface / stop-and-fix/enforcement** — LOCAL: FAIL ❌
   - 1 check FAILED

**Parity result: FAIL — 1 check failed**

---

## Verdict

- verdict: REJECTION-PACKAGE
- token_reference: IAA-019-20260228-REJECT
- failures_cited:
  - CORE-016: `iaa_audit_token: IAA-session-018-20260228-PASS` is incorrect (session-018 was REJECT not PASS); `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section contains placeholder/Foreman summary, not actual verbatim IAA output.
    Fix: (1) Paste verbatim this REJECTION-PACKAGE into section; (2) Update token to IAA-019-20260228-REJECT; (3) Re-invoke IAA third time; (4) After PASS, append ASSURANCE-TOKEN verbatim + update token; (5) Commit + open PR.
- content_changes_correct: TRUE — D1, D2, D3, D4 content all verified correct across both session-018 and session-019. Do NOT modify content.
- adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict: PHASE_B_BLOCKING

## Learning Notes

1. **"Paste verbatim" means the actual formatted block, not a summary**: Session-018 explicitly said "paste this REJECTION-PACKAGE verbatim." The Foreman substituted a narrative summary blockquote. This is a repeated failure pattern: agents interpreting "verbatim" as "document the gist of" rather than "copy-paste the exact output." Future fix instructions should specify: "Copy-paste the full text from ═══ to ═══ including all headers, bullets, and borders."

2. **iaa_audit_token must never claim a PASS for a session that issued a REJECTION-PACKAGE**: The Foreman set `iaa_audit_token: IAA-session-018-20260228-PASS` when session-018 ended in REJECTION. This appears to be anticipatory — pre-filling the expected outcome of the second invocation — which is a form of premature success claim. The correct value before IAA issues verdict is `PENDING`. After IAA issues ASSURANCE-TOKEN, it becomes the actual PASS token. Never pre-fill with `-PASS` for a session that ended in `-REJECT`.

3. **CORE-016 three-invocation resolution pattern**: When a first invocation produces REJECTION (missing artifacts), and a second invocation is required after creating those artifacts, the minimum correct sequence to satisfy CORE-016 is: (1) Create artifacts → (2) Invoke IAA #2 → (3) Paste verbatim REJECTION from #2 into section, update token → (4) Invoke IAA #3 → (5) If PASS: update section + token → open PR. Total: 3 invocations minimum when artifacts are missing from invocation #1. The Foreman should be aware of this and design workflows to front-load artifact creation before first invocation.

4. **The iaa_audit_token field semantics**: The `iaa_audit_token` field should reflect the LAST IAA invocation's actual outcome token. It is a tracking field, not a prospective field. It should never say PASS when the prior session ended in REJECT. Suggest adding this to the prehandover-template.md guidance.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

**Improvement 1 (content of fix instruction)**: Future CORE-016 fix instructions should say explicitly: "Copy-paste the ENTIRE IAA output from the first ═══ line to the last ═══ line, character-for-character, including all formatting. A summary or paraphrase does NOT satisfy 'verbatim'." Adding this explicit guidance to the CORE-016 failure template in the core-invariants-checklist.md would prevent repeated misinterpretation.

**Improvement 2 (prehandover-template.md)**: The `iaa_audit_token` field guidance in the template should read: `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` with a comment: `# Set to PENDING before IAA invocation. Update to IAA-NNN-YYYYMMDD-PASS ONLY after IAA issues ASSURANCE-TOKEN. Never pre-fill with -PASS. Never claim PASS for a session that ended in REJECT.` This prevents the premature PASS pre-filling pattern observed in this session.

---

## Parking Station

Entry logged to `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md`:
- CORE-016 fix instruction should specify character-for-character copy-paste, not paraphrase
- iaa_audit_token field in prehandover-template.md should warn against pre-filling -PASS

---

## fail_only_once_updates

No new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rules added. The learning notes above document patterns that are already covered by CORE-016 and the session-018 fix instruction. If the "verbatim means verbatim" misinterpretation recurs in a third session, add a dedicated FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule.
