## Verdict

**verdict**: ASSURANCE-TOKEN
**token_reference**: IAA-WAVE6-20260225-PASS
**adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict**: PHASE_A_ADVISORY

---

## Advisory Findings (non-blocking)

| ID | Finding | Severity |
|----|---------|---------|
| A-F-1 | api-builder session memory uses narrative markdown for preflight attestation ("Read `.github/agents/api-builder.md`. Identity extracted:") rather than the structured YAML block (`phase_1_preflight.agent_file_read: YES`) used by qa-builder in the same wave. Both formats evidence compliance; inconsistency creates minor audit friction. | MINOR — advisory |
| A-F-2 | PREHANDOVER proof iaa_audit_token field is correctly marked PENDING (Foreman left placeholder for IAA to fill). This is correct process flow. Future sessions should confirm this field is updated in the commit bundle after IAA issues its token. | PROCESS NOTE — advisory |

**prior_sessions_reviewed**: session-001-20260225 (Wave 5 AAWP_MAT — ASSURANCE-TOKEN: IAA-WAVE5-20260225-PASS)

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

**fail_only_once_rules_applied**:

| Rule | Applied | Outcome |
|------|---------|---------|
| A-001: IAA invocation evidence must be present | YES | PASS — PREHANDOVER proof section "IAA Invocation Record" + iaa_audit_token PENDING placeholder both evidence Foreman's Step 4.3a IAA invocation |
| A-002: IAA mandatory for ALL agent contract classes | YES | PASS — Foreman correctly invoked IAA; no exemption claimed; both builder classes included |
| A-003: Ambiguity resolves to mandatory invocation | N/A — category unambiguous (AAWP_MAT) | N/A |

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY — this field may NEVER be blank)

1. **Standardise preflight attestation format across builder classes**: Both builders comply with Phase 1 preflight requirements, but qa-builder uses structured YAML (`phase_1_preflight.agent_file_read: YES`) while api-builder uses prose markdown. The Foreman delegation template (improvement suggested in session-055) should also specify the expected output format for preflight attestation in session memory. Standardising to YAML makes IAA verification deterministic and scriptable.

2. **PREHANDOVER token update ceremony**: The PREHANDOVER proof correctly leaves `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`. A lightweight ceremony should be codified — after IAA issues a token, the Foreman (or an automated script) appends the token reference to the PREHANDOVER proof before the PR is opened. This closes the loop on the artifact bundle integrity.

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Updates

**fail_only_once_updates**: none this session — no recurring pattern identified. Session-001 advisory A-F-2 (inaccurate model name in PREHANDOVER) did not recur. Session-001 advisory A-F-1 (commit bundling) did not recur (Wave 6 commit is a clean single-purpose commit: `feat(ai-centre): Wave 6 — AnthropicAdapter, OpenAI image-gen, course-crafter-advisor persona`). No new rule warranted at this time.

This post-merge audit is mandatory per governance breach requirements and serves as the official
retrospective assurance record. All content checks are performed against the merged HEAD state.
IAA's binary verdict applies to the PR bundle as a record of compliance / non-compliance.

---

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Learning Applied

**A-001 (IAA invocation evidence in PR artifacts)**:
Evidence: PR #546 description contains NO reference to IAA invocation, no ASSURANCE-TOKEN,
no PREHANDOVER proof artifact listing, and no session memory artifacts. No IAA evidence present.
Outcome: FAIL ❌ — Process violation confirmed. IAA was not invoked before or during PR #546.

**A-002 (No class exception — builder class mandatory)**:
Evidence: PR #546 description does not claim class exemption. The content of the modified
contracts explicitly maintains NO-CLASS-EXEMPTION prohibitions in their YAML blocks.
Outcome: PASS ✅ — No class exemption claim made in the PR.

**A-003 (Ambiguity resolves to mandatory invocation)**:
Evidence: PR category is unambiguous (AGENT_CONTRACT — five `.github/agents/*.md` files modified).
No ambiguity present. Ambiguity rule not needed but confirms IAA was mandatory.
Outcome: PASS ✅ — Category clear; mandatory invocation was required and not executed.

---

## Core Invariants Results (Post-Merge State)

**CORE-001: YAML frontmatter valid**
Evidence: All five contracts parse cleanly post-merge. YAML delimiters balanced.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**CORE-002: Agent version correct**
Evidence: All five retain `agent.version: 6.2.0`.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**CORE-003: Contract version present**
Evidence: All five retain `agent.contract_version: 4.0.0`.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**CORE-004: Identity block complete (identity.role, mission, class_boundary)**
Evidence: PR #546 added `identity.role`, `identity.mission`, `identity.class_boundary` to all five.
Post-merge state: all three fields present in all five YAML frontmatters.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five) — session-001 failure RESOLVED

**CORE-005: Governance block present (protocol, version, canon_inventory)**
Evidence: PR #546 added `governance.version: v6.2.0` to all five governance blocks.
Post-merge state: all five have governance.version present.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five) — session-001 failure RESOLVED

**CORE-006: CANON_INVENTORY alignment**
Evidence: No change from session-001 observation. All five list expected_artifacts referencing
upstream governance files. Local CANON_INVENTORY hash integrity confirmed: zero null/empty hashes.
Verdict: OBSERVATION — same as session-001; not a hard FAIL.

**CORE-007: No placeholder content**
Evidence: PR #546 removed the duplicate terminal `*END OF SCHEMA BUILDER FOUR-PHASE CANONICAL
CONTRACT*` line from schema-builder.md. All five contracts now have exactly one END marker.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five) — session-001 failure RESOLVED

**CORE-008: Prohibitions block present (id, rule, enforcement fields)**
Evidence: PR #546 restructured all prohibitions in all five contracts from plain string arrays
to structured objects with `id`, `rule`, and `enforcement` fields. Example (api-builder):
```yaml
- id: NO-CLASS-EXEMPTION
  rule: "I NEVER claim this builder is exempt from IAA oversight..."
  enforcement: CONSTITUTIONAL
```
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five) — session-001 failure RESOLVED

**CORE-009: Merge gate interface present**
Evidence: All five retain `merge_gate_interface.required_checks`. No regression.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**CORE-010: Tier 2 knowledge indexed**
Evidence: PR #546 added `tier2_knowledge.index` YAML field to all five contracts AND created
`.agent-workspace/<agent>/knowledge/index.md` stub for all five builders.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five) — session-001 failure RESOLVED

**CORE-011: Four-phase structure present**
Evidence: All four phases remain intact in all five contracts post-merge.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**CORE-012: Self-modification lock present**
Evidence: PR #546 aligned body `**Lock ID**:` references to YAML `identity.lock_id` values for all five:
- api-builder: body → SELF-MOD-API-001 ✅
- schema-builder: body → SELF-MOD-SCHEMA-001 ✅
- ui-builder: body → SELF-MOD-UI-001 ✅
- qa-builder: body → SELF-MOD-QA-001 ✅
- integration-builder: body → SELF-MOD-INT-001 ✅ (previously erroneous SELF-MOD-002 corrected)
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five) — session-001 failure RESOLVED

**CORE-013: IAA invocation evidence**
Evidence: PR #546 bundle contains NO IAA invocation evidence:
- No ASSURANCE-TOKEN reference in PR description
- No PREHANDOVER proof artifact listed or linked
- No session memory artifacts included
- No IAA advisory mode reference
- PR description mentions zero IAA-related process steps
This is a direct violation of AGCFPP-001, CodexAdvisor contract §4.4 and §4.5, and FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-001.
Verdict: FAIL ❌ — IAA invocation evidence ABSENT from PR bundle
Finding: PR #546 modified 5 builder agent contracts (AGENT_CONTRACT category) without IAA invocation.
This is a governance process violation. AGCFPP-001 applies. FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-001 triggered.

**CORE-014: No class exemption claim**
Evidence: PR #546 description does not claim class exemption. All five contracts retain and
extend NO-CLASS-EXEMPTION prohibitions.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**CORE-015: Session memory present**
Evidence: PR #546 bundle contains NO session memory artifacts. No `.agent-workspace/
CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/session-NNN-*.md` file was included in the PR.
Verdict: FAIL ❌ — Session memory ABSENT from bundle
Finding: No CodexAdvisor session memory accompanies this agent contract modification PR.
Fix: Session memory and PREHANDOVER proof must be created retroactively (this session resolves it).

---

## Category Overlay Results (AGENT_CONTRACT)

Evidence: All five retain policy_refs with AGCFPP-001 iaa-invocation-mandate role.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five — via policy_refs path)

**OVL-AC-003: Four-phase canonical structure**
Evidence: All four phases present and intact in all five contracts post-merge.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**OVL-AC-004: Self-modification prohibition CONSTITUTIONAL enforcement**

Evidence: PR #546 bundle contains NO PREHANDOVER proof artifact. No `.agent-workspace/
CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-NNN-*.md` file in the PR diff.
Verdict: FAIL ❌ — PREHANDOVER proof ABSENT from PR bundle
Finding: CodexAdvisor contract §4.2 and EVIDENCE_ARTIFACT_BUNDLE_STANDARD.md require PREHANDOVER
proof to be included in every agent contract modification PR. This was omitted.

**OVL-AC-007: Session memory in bundle**
Evidence: No session memory artifact present in PR #546 bundle.
Verdict: FAIL ❌ — Session memory ABSENT from bundle
Finding: CodexAdvisor contract §4.3 requires session memory with every PR. Omitted in PR #546.

**OVL-AC-008: Tier 2 stub present (.agent-workspace/<agent>/knowledge/index.md)**
Evidence: PR #546 created index.md stubs for all five builders. All five present post-merge.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five) — session-001 failure RESOLVED

**OVL-AC-009: Character count within limit (< 30,000)**
Evidence: Post-merge character counts (all within limit):

- schema-builder: approximately 27,200 chars ✅ (duplicate END removed, new YAML added)
- ui-builder: approximately 29,300 chars ✅
- qa-builder: approximately 28,200 chars ✅
- integration-builder: approximately 28,100 chars ✅
Note: ui-builder is approaching the 30,000-character limit. Monitoring warranted.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**OVL-AC-010: No hardcoded version strings**
Evidence: Phase bodies reference governance documents by path and title. No hardcoded version
strings in phase execution logic. YAML identity read from YAML block, not from body.

## Verdict

═══════════════════════════════════════
REJECTION-PACKAGE
Audit scope: PR #546 — 5 builder agent contract modifications (post-merge retrospective audit)

CONTENT VERDICT: PASS — All 7 session-001 failures correctly remediated.
The technical content of the changes to the five builder contracts is accepted as accurate and
complete. The YAML additions, structural fixes, and Tier 2 stubs are all correct.

PROCESS VERDICT: FAIL — 5 process violations detected.
GOVERNANCE PROCESS VIOLATIONS (AGCFPP-001, CodexAdvisor contract §4.4–§4.5):
  CORE-013: IAA invocation evidence ABSENT from PR bundle.
    Finding: PR #546 was submitted and merged without IAA audit invocation. No ASSURANCE-TOKEN,
    no advisory mode reference, no IAA evidence of any kind in the PR artifacts.
    FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-001 violated.
    Fix: CodexAdvisor must (1) record this as AGCFPP-001-PR546 breach in breach-registry.md;
    (2) add A-002 rule to FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md; (3) create retroactive session memory + PREHANDOVER
    proof for this PR's session. All future agent contract PRs MUST include IAA evidence.
  CORE-015: Session memory ABSENT from PR bundle.
    Finding: No CodexAdvisor session memory file was included in PR #546.
    Fix: Create retroactive session memory (session-030) documenting this session.
  OVL-AC-006: PREHANDOVER proof ABSENT from PR bundle.
    Finding: No PREHANDOVER proof artifact was included in PR #546.
    Fix: Create retroactive PREHANDOVER proof (PREHANDOVER-session-030).
  OVL-AC-007: Session memory in bundle ABSENT.
    Finding: Same as CORE-015 — session memory not present in bundle.
  FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-001: IAA invocation evidence missing.
    Finding: This rule was established in session-001 context (PRs #523, #528, #531) and
    CodexAdvisor's own A-001 (FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md) was created in session-029 to prevent exactly
    this recurrence. PR #546 was submitted the same day as session-029 without compliance.

BREACH CLASSIFICATION: AGCFPP-001 — Agent Contract File Protection Policy violation.
Severity: HIGH — Five governance-protected agent contracts modified without IAA oversight.
Note: CS2 (@APGI-cmy) approved the merge. CS2 authorization is confirmed. However, the
process requirement for IAA invocation is independent of CS2 merge authorization.
The breach is recorded. The content is accepted. No revert required.

ADOPTION PHASE: PHASE_A_ADVISORY — As noted in session-001, Phase A verdict is informational.
The content remediation is accepted. The process violation is formally recorded and must be
addressed by CodexAdvisor's breach registry and FAIL-ONLY-ONCE learning update.

Token reference: N/A — REJECTION-PACKAGE issued (process violation, post-merge audit)

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied
- fail_only_once_rules_applied:
    - rule_id: A-001
      outcome: FAIL
      notes: IAA invocation evidence absent from PR #546 bundle. This is the exact failure mode
             A-001 was created to prevent. PR #546 was submitted same day A-001 was created
             (session-029). Rule was created before PR was opened — violation occurred during
             the same session cycle.
    - rule_id: A-002
      outcome: PASS
      notes: No class exemption claim present in PR #546. Builder class IAA mandate maintained
             in all five contract bodies.
    - rule_id: A-003
      outcome: PASS
      notes: Category unambiguous (AGENT_CONTRACT). Ambiguity rule not triggered.

---

## Learning Notes

1. **Preflight format divergence is a pattern to watch**: qa-builder (remediation session) used explicit YAML; api-builder (direct delegation) used prose. This is session-002's first observation of this divergence. If it recurs in session-003, add a FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule requiring YAML format.
2. **QP-FAIL-then-remediation cycle works correctly**: Foreman correctly caught qa-builder's missing preflight in the first delivery, issued QP FAIL, re-delegated with explicit requirement, and accepted only after evidence was produced. This is the correct POLC control loop working as designed. IAA's independent verification confirms the loop closed correctly.
3. **Single-commit wave bundles are cleaner**: The Wave 6 commit bundles all 7 artifact files in one purposeful commit (`feat(ai-centre):`). This is an improvement over the session-001 observation (A-F-2: Wave 5 mixed governance + builder artifacts). Positive pattern — reinforce.
4. **copilot-swe-agent as builder implementation vehicle**: The git commit is authored by `copilot-swe-agent[bot]` co-authored by CS2. This is the correct pattern — IAA treats copilot-swe-agent as the builder implementation vehicle, with Foreman providing orchestration oversight and CS2 as ultimate authority. POLC boundary holds.

*Authority: CS2 (Johan Ras / @APGI-cmy) | independent-assurance-agent v2.0.0 | 2026-02-25*
- learning_notes: >
    PR #546 represents a significant governance failure pattern: CodexAdvisor submitted a correct
    and well-executed content remediation, but violated the process requirement for IAA invocation
    that it had codified for itself in the same session (session-029 created FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-001,
    which requires IAA for all agent contract PRs). The failure likely occurred because CodexAdvisor
    treated the PR as a "technical fix" rather than a "governance-protected file change" — the same
    class of reasoning error (treating an agent contract modification as something other than
    AGENT_CONTRACT category) that A-001 was designed to prevent. Recommendations: (1) Add a
    pre-PR checklist gate specific to AGCFPP-001-protected paths: any change to .github/agents/*.md
    must trigger mandatory IAA check before proceeding to Phase 4. (2) The evidence bundle
    requirement (PREHANDOVER + session memory) should be enforced as a blocking gate in CodexAdvisor's
    Phase 3 Step 3.7 — if the bundle is incomplete, the PR must not be opened. (3) The sequence
    "create FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule in session X, then violate it in the same session's subsequent PR"
    indicates the rule check occurs at the wrong point in the workflow — it must be applied AT THE
    PR OPENING STEP, not just during RAEC review.

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Updates
- fail_only_once_updates: >
    Adding A-004: "Post-merge retrospective audit triggers mandatory breach recording — CodexAdvisor
    FAIL-ONLY-ONCE and breach-registry.md must be updated in the same session as the retrospective
    audit." This prevents governance findings from being noted without formal recording.

## Prior Sessions Reviewed
- prior_sessions_reviewed: [session-001-20260225]

## Unresolved Items Carried Forward
- unresolved_items:
    - CodexAdvisor must update FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md with A-002 rule (PR #546 process violation)
    - CodexAdvisor must create breach-registry.md entry for AGCFPP-001-PR546
    - CodexAdvisor must create retroactive session-030 memory and PREHANDOVER-session-030 proof
    - IAA FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-004 rule to be codified (post-merge audit → mandatory breach recording)
    - CORE-008 advisory (PHASE_A): structured prohibitions canon definition pending in
      INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md — not a PR #546 failure but a system gap

## Suggestions for Improvement
- suggestions: >
    Concrete improvement: Add a file-path guard in CodexAdvisor's Phase 2 that fires BEFORE
    any work begins — if the PR will touch any `.github/agents/*.md` file, IAA invocation must
    be planned and evidence must be included in the COORDINATE step (Phase 3.7). Currently this
    check occurs at Phase 3.2 (IAA trigger classification) but is not enforced again at Phase 4.
    A dual-gate (Phase 2 plan + Phase 4 verify) would prevent the exact failure seen in PR #546.
    Secondary improvement: Evidence bundle completeness (PREHANDOVER + session memory + IAA evidence)
    should be a CI-enforced check rather than a manual checklist item.
