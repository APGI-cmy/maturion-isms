# IAA Session Memory — Session 010 — 2026-02-26

## Session Identity
- session_id: session-010-20260226
- date: 2026-02-26
- agent_version: 6.2.0
- contract_version: 2.0.0

## Invocation Context
- pr_reviewed: Branch copilot/orchestrate-aimc-analysis-integration — MAT Wave 8: AIMC Analysis Integration
- invoking_agent: foreman-v2-agent v6.2.0 (session-061-20260226)
- producing_agent: qa-builder (RED gate tests) + api-builder (implementation, ai-scoring.ts refactor, tracker update)
- producing_agent_class: builder (×2), supervised by foreman-v2-agent (foreman class)

## Classification
- pr_category: AAWP_MAT
- ambiguity_rule_applied: NO — category unambiguously AAWP_MAT; no .github/agents/ files in diff
- foreman_builder_mandate_applied: NO — no agent contract files in this PR
- invocation_type: PRE-MERGE — correctly invoked before PR open (Foreman held PR pending IAA token per contract A-010 / IAA-INVOKE-001)

## Adoption Phase
- adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict: PHASE_A_ADVISORY
- IAA is not yet in Phase B. This audit is advisory. All findings formally recorded.
- Merge authority remains with CS2.

## Checks Executed
- checks_executed: 22
- fail_only_once_checks: 4
- core_invariants_checks: 6
- category_overlay_checks: 12

## Results
- checks_passed: 22
- checks_failed: 0
- advisory_findings: 1 (non-blocking — ai-routing-table.ts backward-compat file still contains gpt-4-turbo/gpt-4o-mini model names; accepted per foreman S-010 improvement note; Wave 8 acceptance criteria only required ai-scoring.ts to be clean, which it is)
- merge_gate_parity_result: PASS

## Verdict
- verdict: ASSURANCE-TOKEN
- token_reference: IAA-session-010-20260226-PASS
- failures_cited: none

## Prior Sessions Reviewed
- prior_sessions_reviewed: [session-005-20260225, session-006-20260225, session-007-20260226, session-008-20260226, session-009-20260226]
- unresolved_items_from_prior_sessions: none
- open_rejection_packages_from_prior_sessions: none

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied
- fail_only_once_rules_applied:
    - A-001 (own invocation evidence): PASS — foreman PREHANDOVER references IAA invocation at Step 4.3a; this session is the formal IAA invocation
    - A-002 (no class exceptions): PASS — not applicable (no agent contract files in PR); no exemption claim made
    - A-003 (ambiguity resolves to mandatory): PASS — no ambiguity; AAWP_MAT unambiguous
    - A-004 (bootstrap compliance): PASS — contract read via agent-bootstrap tool as first action; no repo file read before Phase 1 completion
- fail_only_once_updates: none (no new recurring patterns identified; clean delivery)

## Wave 8 Acceptance Criteria Verified (implementation-plan.md §2.9)
- analysis-service.ts created at modules/mat/src/services/analysis-service.ts: CONFIRMED
- routes via Capability.ANALYSIS through AICentre: CONFIRMED (lines 76, 133, 200)
- ai-scoring.ts has no gpt-4-turbo or gpt-4o-mini: CONFIRMED (extracted to ai-routing-table.ts)
- BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER Wave 8 = COMPLETE: CONFIRMED (line 246 and 1277)
- All 10 Wave 8 tests GREEN: CONFIRMED (MAT-T-AIMC-011 to MAT-T-AIMC-020 all pass)
- All prior tests GREEN: CONFIRMED (153/153, 16/16 files)
- Zero regressions: CONFIRMED

## Learning Notes
1. Wave 8 delivery was the cleanest delivery audited to date: 22/22 checks PASS, test count
   exactly matches PREHANDOVER claim (153/153), all Wave 8 acceptance criteria met precisely.
   Foreman's S-010 improvement suggestion (ai-routing-table.ts cleanup) demonstrates correct
   improvement tracking pattern — non-blocking item surfaced to parking station for future wave.
2. The Wave 8 PREHANDOVER proof structure was exemplary: CS2 authorization, AIMC prerequisite
   verification, builder delegation evidence, test run output with full counts, OPOJD gate table,
   §4.3 merge gate parity check, acceptance criteria table, and IAA invocation record. This should
   be used as the canonical template for future AAWP_MAT wave PREHANDOVER proofs.
3. Foreman correctly flagged ai-routing-table.ts coupling (S-010) as a follow-up item rather than
   blocking Wave 8. This is the correct governance behavior: Wave 8 acceptance criteria were
   satisfied; future cleanup is tracked but not retroactively blocking.
4. Pre-merge IAA invocation pattern (IAA-INVOKE-001) was followed correctly: foreman held the PR
   open pending IAA token, then submitted the IAA request. This is the ideal pattern and confirms
   the Phase A→B transition is progressing well in the team.

## Suggestions for Improvement

MANDATORY FIELD — populated:

No degradation observed. Continuous improvement note: The Wave 8 delivery demonstrates the
value of the QA-to-Red-before-Build pattern — having 3 of 10 tests as regression guards (GREEN
pre-implementation) rather than acceptance criteria (RED pre-implementation) is a deliberate and
correct practice. IAA should explicitly check for this pattern balance in future AAWP_MAT audits:
a test suite with *only* RED tests (no regression guards) is a warning sign that prior
architecture compliance is not being monitored. Future overlay check: "Does the test suite include
at least one regression guard verifying prior wave compliance?"
