## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

- fail_only_once_rules_applied:
  - A-001 (IAA invocation evidence for AGENT_CONTRACT): CANON_GOVERNANCE category — A-001 refers to AGENT_CONTRACT. CORE-013 covers CANON_GOVERNANCE evidence. PASS (PREHANDOVER present with real token).
  - A-002 (no class exceptions): CONFIRMED — foreman explicitly invoked IAA; no exemption claimed. PASS.
  - A-003 (ambiguity resolves to mandatory): N/A — category unambiguous. PASS.
  - A-004 (bootstrap first): ATTESTED — bootstrap tool called as absolute first action this session. PASS.
  - A-005 (no .github/agents/ modifications): CONFIRMED — `git diff --name-only HEAD` and `git status` both show zero .github/agents/ files. PASS.
  - A-006 (PHASE_A_ADVISORY FABRICATION detection): iaa_audit_token is `IAA-019-20260228-REJECT` — does NOT match `PHASE_A_ADVISORY — \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}` pattern. A-006 not triggered. PASS.

- fail_only_once_updates: NONE this session — no new recurring patterns identified. Three-invocation resolution pattern from session-019 was an isolated case resolved by this session.

## Learning Notes

1. **Three-invocation resolution pattern confirmed**: The CORE-016 three-invocation pattern documented in session-019 LN-3 was confirmed this session. Invocation 1 (session-017): REJECT — missing artifacts. Invocation 2 (session-018): REJECT — CORE-013/015/016 failures. Invocation 3 (session-019): REJECT — CORE-016 verbatim not genuine. Invocation 4 (session-020): PASS. The actual count was four invocations for this PR (sessions 017, 018, 019, 020), not three. Session-019 LN-3 predicted three minimum — the actual minimum is higher if fix instructions are misinterpreted on iteration 3. This pattern is now fully documented across four sessions.

2. **"Verbatim" instruction followed precisely on fourth invocation**: The fix instruction from session-019 explicitly said "Copy-paste the full text from ═══ to ═══ including all formatting." The Foreman followed this precisely in the remediated PREHANDOVER proof (confirmed by block-by-block comparison with session-019 session memory). This is the first time the verbatim instruction was correctly followed. Learning: explicit character-for-character instructions DO succeed when repeated precisely.

3. **iaa_audit_token semantics now correctly applied**: Token `IAA-019-20260228-REJECT` correctly reflects the last real IAA output — a REJECTION-PACKAGE. This is the correct use of the field (trailing token = last actual outcome, pending update to PASS after this session's ASSURANCE-TOKEN). The prehandover-template.md (D4) documents this semantics explicitly. This closes the loop on LN-2 from session-019.

4. **Stable content across all four invocations**: All D1–D4 content files (iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md, iaa-trigger-table.md, iaa-category-overlays.md, FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md, index.md, INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md, CANON_INVENTORY.json, prehandover-template.md, foreman index.md) were verified correct in sessions 018, 019, and 020. No content modifications were made between invocations 2-4. The three REJECTION-PACKAGEs were all for evidence bundle metadata issues, not content issues. This confirms that the governance-liaison-isms-agent produced correct content on the first attempt.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

**Improvement 1 (prehandover update after PASS)**: Now that this session issues ASSURANCE-TOKEN IAA-020-20260228-PASS, the Foreman must update the PREHANDOVER proof's iaa_audit_token field to `IAA-020-20260228-PASS` and append this ASSURANCE-TOKEN verbatim to the `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section before opening the PR. The current token `IAA-019-20260228-REJECT` is correct as a pre-PASS placeholder but must be updated before merge. Suggest adding this step explicitly to the prehandover-template.md workflow: "After receiving ASSURANCE-TOKEN from third invocation: (1) update iaa_audit_token to PASS token, (2) append ASSURANCE-TOKEN block verbatim, (3) commit, (4) open PR."

**Improvement 2 (front-load evidence bundle)**: Across all four invocations of this PR, content was correct from invocation 1 (session-017). The three prior REJECTIONs were all for evidence bundle issues (missing PREHANDOVER, missing session memory, incorrect verbatim section). A pre-invocation checklist item "evidence bundle complete?" would have resolved all three rejections before first IAA invocation, compressing four sessions into one. Suggest adding a mandatory "evidence bundle checklist" gate to the Foreman workflow before IAA invocation: (a) PREHANDOVER proof exists? (b) session memory exists? (c) ## IAA Agent Response (verbatim) section present with a placeholder token? If any item fails, do not invoke IAA yet.

## Parking Station

Entries to be appended to `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md`:
- `| 2026-02-28 | independent-assurance-agent | session-020 | [PHASE-4] | After ASSURANCE-TOKEN: Foreman must update iaa_audit_token to PASS token and append verbatim block before opening PR | session-020-20260228.md |`
- `| 2026-02-28 | independent-assurance-agent | session-020 | [PHASE-4] | Pre-IAA evidence bundle checklist would prevent repeated REJECTION-PACKAGEs for missing artifacts | session-020-20260228.md |`

---

## fail_only_once_updates

No new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rules added this session. The "four-invocation pattern" observed is a one-time resolution of a compounding error chain (missing artifacts → missing session memory → incorrect verbatim → correct verbatim). The learning is captured above but does not meet the threshold for a new A-rule (no new systemic failure pattern identified — prior rules A-006 and CORE-016 already address the root cause).
