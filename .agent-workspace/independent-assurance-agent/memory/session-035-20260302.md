## Phase 1 Preflight Record

**bootstrap_directive_complied**: YES — agent-bootstrap-agent_bootstrap called as absolute first action (A-004 attested). No repo files read before contract loaded.

**tier2_knowledge_loaded**: YES
- index.md — v1.2.0 — PRESENT
- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md — v1.2.0 — PRESENT (A-001 through A-017 active; duplicate A-004×2 and A-016×2 IDs noted from prior sessions — pending CodexAdvisor deduplication)
- iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md — v2.1.0 — ACTIVE
- iaa-trigger-table.md — PRESENT
- iaa-category-overlays.md — PRESENT
- session-memory-template.md — PRESENT

**canon_inventory_verified**: PASS — IAA canon present. Apparent "placeholder" keys (version, total_canons, canon_entry_schema) are metadata fields at top level, not artifact hash entries — confirmed false positive from parse script. Actual canons array verified intact.

**breach_registry_status**: NO OPEN BREACHES. All prior advisory findings (B-001/B-002/B-003) closed/advisory recorded.

## Phase 3 Checks

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-001 | PASS ✅ | session-034 iaa_invocation_result: PENDING — real-time IAA invocation confirmed |
| FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-002 | PASS ✅ | No class exemption claimed; liaison invoked IAA correctly |
| FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-006 | PASS ✅ | No bare PHASE_A_ADVISORY date string; PENDING is correct pre-invocation state |

| FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-017 | PASS ✅ | No REJECTION session cited as PASS |
| CORE-001 to CORE-004 | N/A | AGENT_CONTRACT only — not applicable to CI_WORKFLOW |
| CORE-005 | PASS ✅ | Authority headers present in all delivered artifacts |
| CORE-006 | PASS ✅ | No canon files changed; local CANON_INVENTORY intact |
| CORE-007 | PASS ✅ | No TODO/FIXME/STUB/TBD; "placeholder" string in script is echo output, not artifact placeholder |
| CORE-008 to CORE-012 | N/A | AGENT_CONTRACT only |
| CORE-013 | PASS ✅ | session-034 session memory explicitly documents IAA PENDING invocation |
| CORE-014 | PASS ✅ | No class exemption claimed |
| CORE-015 | PASS ✅ | session-034-20260302.md present and fully populated in PR bundle |
| CORE-016 | PASS ✅ | Real-time invocation (this session); PENDING state is correct pre-invocation pattern per Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN Ceremony |
| CORE-017 | PASS ✅ | NO_AGENT_FILES_CHANGED confirmed by git diff |
| OVL-CI-001 | PASS ✅ | Merge gate checks not modified; ripple workflow is separate from merge gate |
| OVL-CI-002 | PASS ✅ | exit 1→2 only for stale inventory edge case; genuine drift path unchanged |
| OVL-CI-003 | PASS ✅ | Parity enforcement fields not present in ripple workflow; no weakening |
| OVL-CI-004 | PASS ✅ | Logic correctly implements stale hash detection; security properties maintained |

---

## Phase 4 Merge Gate Parity

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| YAML validation (ripple-integration.yml) | PASS ✅ |
| Bash syntax (align-governance.sh) | PASS ✅ |
| Placeholder scan — all artifacts | PASS ✅ |
| Canon hash verification (no canon files changed) | PASS ✅ |
| Agent file immutability (.github/agents/) | PASS ✅ |
| Gate weakening check (diff review) | PASS ✅ |
| SHA256 — align-governance.sh: 844eff43... claimed = actual | PASS ✅ |
| SHA256 — ripple-integration.yml: 727a0ffb... claimed = actual | PASS ✅ |

**Parity result**: PASS

## Learning Notes

1. **Governance-liaison CI_WORKFLOW invocation pattern is well-formed**: Session-034 used `iaa_invocation_result: PENDING` in session memory before invoking IAA. This is the correct Phase B pattern. The session memory serves as the PREHANDOVER equivalent for liaison class agents. No ceremony gaps observed.

2. **Stale canonical CANON_INVENTORY hash is a valid, recurring risk class**: The root cause of Issue #777 (stale hash in upstream foreman-governance CANON_INVENTORY.json) represents a governance inventory maintenance gap. The fix correctly addresses the consumer-side resilience (exit 2), but the root cause (upstream inventory staleness) remains open as GOVERNANCE_GAP. Future IAA invocations should watch for similar patterns where upstream inventory falls behind actual file state.

3. **Exit code semantics as governance signals**: The use of exit 2 as "partial success / escalation required" vs exit 0 (success) and exit 1 (hard failure) is a well-established Unix pattern. This PR correctly implements it with clear documentation, warning emission, and session memory escalation tracking. This pattern may be worth formalizing in governance scripts documentation.

4. **OVL-CI-004 (workflow policy correctness) is the highest-value CI overlay check**: For this session, OVL-CI-004 required the most detailed analysis (tracing Phase 3 + Phase 4 logic, edge cases, security properties). The check correctly caught that logic needed to be traced end-to-end, not just structure-verified. This confirms OVL-CI-004 adds significant independent value.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Upstream canonical repo CANON_INVENTORY.json maintenance**: The canonical `maturion-foreman-governance` CANON_INVENTORY.json has a stale hash for `LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md`. The governance-repo-administrator should update this entry to `ac23efd1b44ac26b620cf387fdba6b23031ac988a5b51fb304eb215ce7ffc58f`. This would close the GOVERNANCE_GAP escalation and prevent future stale hash warnings in ripple runs.

2. **Consider adding a Phase 0 "inventory health check" step to ripple-integration.yml**: Before running align-governance.sh, a lightweight pre-flight step could compare all canonical inventory hashes against canonical actual file hashes and report a summary. This would surface all stale entries proactively, not just the one(s) encountered during drift detection. Governance-liaison session-034 suggestion #2 aligns with this.

3. **FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md deduplication (carried from prior sessions)**: Duplicate rule IDs (A-004×2, A-016×2) should be renamed to A-018/A-019 by CodexAdvisor to restore unique ID integrity. This has been flagged in sessions 030, 031, 032, and again here — escalation to CodexAdvisor is overdue.
