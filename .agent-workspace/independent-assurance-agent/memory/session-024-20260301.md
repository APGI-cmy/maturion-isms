- iaa-trigger-table.md — v2.0.0 — ACTIVE
- iaa-category-overlays.md — v2.0.0 — ACTIVE
- session-memory-template.md — v1.0.0 — PRESENT

**tier2_gap_flagged**: NO — all files present and active

**canon_inventory_check**: PASS
- Total canons: 188
- Bad hashes: 0
- IAA canon present: YES
- AGCFPP-001 present: YES

**wake_up_protocol**: EXECUTED — v6.2.0 — 25 prior sessions found

---

## Phase 2 Alignment Record

**invocation_context**:
- PR: copilot/identify-layer-up-candidates — Layer-Up Triage session-076 (trigger: APGI-cmy/maturion-isms#707)
- invoked_by: foreman-v2-agent (session-076) — RE-INVOCATION
- work_produced_by: foreman-v2-agent, class: foreman
- artifacts_under_review: 26 layer-up issue specification files (including new issue-spec-25 and issue-spec-26) + LAYER_UP_CANDIDATES.md (updated to 26 total with 6.8/6.9 entries) + session-076 memory (updated) + PREHANDOVER proof (updated with reject token reference)
- prior_rejection_package: IAA-session-023-20260301-REJECT (FC-5 finding)
- wave_type: documentation/planning only — no production code changes

**independence_check**: CONFIRMED — IAA did not produce this work

**pr_category**: AMBIGUOUS → IAA MANDATORY (AMBIGUITY RULE — same as session-023)

**iaa_triggered**: YES — AMBIGUITY RULE
**foreman_builder_mandate_check**: APPLICABLE — Foreman-class agent work; invocation mandatory

**fail_only_once_a006_check**: NOT TRIGGERED. iaa_audit_token = `IAA-session-023-20260301-REJECT (first invocation — FC-5 finding resolved — re-invocation pending)` — this is a real IAA REJECT token reference, NOT the PHASE_A_ADVISORY FABRICATION pattern. The verbatim section placeholder is the correct pre-invocation state for re-invocation (same precedent as PENDING in session-023).

| CORE-008 to CORE-012 | NO | N/A | Not AGENT_CONTRACT |
| CORE-013 | YES | PASS | PREHANDOVER proof present; iaa_audit_token references real REJECT token IAA-session-023-20260301-REJECT; this session IS the invocation evidence |
| CORE-014 | YES | PASS | No class exemption claimed; Foreman correctly re-invoked IAA |
| CORE-015 | YES | PASS | Session memory at .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-076-layer-up-triage-20260301.md — present and updated with 26 total |
| CORE-016 | YES | PASS | iaa_audit_token is real REJECT token (not PHASE_A_ADVISORY pattern); verbatim section placeholder is pre-invocation state; A-006 NOT triggered |
| CORE-017 | YES | PASS | Zero .github/agents/ modifications confirmed via git status |

### Functional Key Claims Checks (FC)

| Check | Verdict | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| FC-1: All 26 specs follow Section 6 format | PASS | Automated scan: 26/26 PASS for all required sections (## Trigger, ## Evidence, ## Current Governance State, ## Observed Gap/Conflict/Failure, ## Proposed Governance Improvement, ## Impact Assessment, Reference:) |
| FC-2: No production code modified | PASS | git status confirms only .agent-admin/ and .agent-workspace/ changes; 0 production code changes |
| FC-3: Session memory complete and updated | PASS | All required fields present; Phase 3 lists 26 total candidates including S-003 and S-005 explicitly; issue-spec-25 and issue-spec-26 in artifact table |
| FC-4: PREHANDOVER proof complete | PASS | All mandatory sections present; bundle completeness table correctly lists all 26 specs; iaa_audit_token updated to REJECT reference; advisory note: narrative descriptions still say "24 issue spec files" (stale count) — non-blocking cosmetic inconsistency |
| FC-5: All 9 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE improvements covered | PASS ← PREVIOUSLY FAILED | S-003 → issue-spec-25 (AAWP deliverable verification); S-005 → issue-spec-26 (governance alignment integration test); all 9 improvements S-001–S-009 now have issue specs; zero silent exclusions |

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

| Rule | Applied | Outcome |
|------|---------|---------|
| A-001 (IAA invocation evidence) | YES | PASS — PREHANDOVER proof present; REJECT token referenced; this session IS the invocation |
| A-002 (no class exceptions) | YES | PASS — Foreman-class agent correctly re-invoked; no exemption |
| A-003 (ambiguity resolves to mandatory) | YES | PASS — AMBIGUOUS category → mandatory; Foreman complied |
| A-004 (bootstrap directive) | YES | PASS — agent_bootstrap called first |
| A-005 (no .github/agents/ modifications) | YES | PASS — zero .github/agents/ changes |
| A-006 (INC-IAA-SKIP-001 detection) | YES | PASS — REJECT token ≠ PHASE_A_ADVISORY FABRICATION pattern; verbatim placeholder = legitimate pre-invocation state |
| A-015 (Tier 2 patches require full ceremony) | YES | PASS — N/A to this wave (no Tier 2 patches) |

**fail_only_once_updates**: None this session — the FC-5 fix was correctly applied; no new governance breach pattern requiring a new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule emerged.

## Learning Notes

1. **Re-invocation iaa_audit_token pattern confirmed**: When a REJECTION-PACKAGE is issued and a fix is applied before re-invocation, the correct iaa_audit_token format for the PREHANDOVER proof during re-invocation is: `IAA-session-NNN-YYYYMMDD-REJECT (first invocation — [fix description] — re-invocation pending)`. This correctly references the real rejection without triggering the A-006 PHASE_A_ADVISORY FABRICATION pattern. The verbatim section placeholder remains acceptable until the ASSURANCE-TOKEN response is pasted. This is the definitive precedent for multi-invocation waves.

2. **Stale narrative counts after fix application (advisory pattern)**: When the FC-5 fix was applied, the PREHANDOVER proof's bundle completeness TABLE was correctly updated (added rows for spec-25 and spec-26), but the OPOJD narrative description ("24 issue spec files") and QP Verdict narrative ("26 artifacts: 24 issue specs + catalog + session memory") were not updated to reflect the new count of 26 specs / 28 total artifacts. This is a recurring risk when fixes are applied mid-wave: the operative sections (bundle completeness table) get updated, but narrative summaries may lag. Future Foreman sessions should update ALL numeric references when adding specs to an existing PREHANDOVER proof. Non-blocking in this instance because the operative table was correct.

3. **FC-5 fix verification is a complete re-audit, not a spot check**: This session fully re-ran all 23 applicable checks — not just the previously-failed FC-5. All prior PASS checks confirmed to still PASS after the fix. This is the correct re-invocation protocol: the entire checklist runs again, not just the delta.

4. **S-005 LOW priority documentation pattern**: issue-spec-26 correctly documents S-005 as LOW priority with explicit justification (the workflow works in practice; this is a quality/coverage improvement). This is the correct pattern for improvements where urgency is genuinely low — the spec should be created (not silently excluded) AND the priority should be accurately set with rationale.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **S-019 (NEW)**: PREHANDOVER proof fix-application protocol — when adding new artifacts to an existing PREHANDOVER proof mid-wave (e.g., after a REJECTION-PACKAGE fix), the Foreman should run a find-and-replace on ALL numeric references (issue spec count, total artifact count) throughout the proof, not just update the bundle completeness table. Suggest adding a "Proof Consistency Check" step to the post-fix checklist: verify that all numeric artifact counts in narrative sections match the bundle completeness table row count.

2. **Continuous improvement**: The re-invocation ceremony worked exactly as designed in this session. The Foreman: (a) correctly received the REJECTION-PACKAGE, (b) applied the specific fix (added specs 25 and 26), (c) updated the iaa_audit_token to reference the rejection, (d) re-invoked IAA. The multi-invocation governance loop is robust. The pattern established in this session (REJECT-token reference + placeholder verbatim section = correct pre-re-invocation state) should be documented in the Foreman Tier 2 knowledge as a canonical re-invocation pattern.
