## Phase 2 Alignment Record

**invocation_context**:
- PR: copilot/identify-layer-up-candidates — Layer-Up Triage session-076 (trigger: APGI-cmy/maturion-isms#707)
- invoked_by: foreman-v2-agent (session-076) — RE-INVOCATION
- work_produced_by: foreman-v2-agent, class: foreman
- artifacts_under_review: 26 layer-up issue specification files (including new issue-spec-25 and issue-spec-26) + LAYER_UP_CANDIDATES.md (updated to 26 total with 6.8/6.9 entries) + session-076 memory (updated) + PREHANDOVER proof (updated with reject token reference)
- prior_rejection_package: IAA-session-023-20260301-REJECT (FC-5 finding)
- wave_type: documentation/planning only — no production code changes

**independence_check**: CONFIRMED — IAA did not produce this work

**pr_category**: AMBIGUOUS → IAA MANDATORY (AMBIGUITY RULE — same as session-023)

**iaa_triggered**: YES — AMBIGUITY RULE
**foreman_builder_mandate_check**: APPLICABLE — Foreman-class agent work; invocation mandatory

**fail_only_once_a006_check**: NOT TRIGGERED. iaa_audit_token = `IAA-session-023-20260301-REJECT (first invocation — FC-5 finding resolved — re-invocation pending)` — this is a real IAA REJECT token reference, NOT the PHASE_A_ADVISORY FABRICATION pattern. The verbatim section placeholder is the correct pre-invocation state for re-invocation (same precedent as PENDING in session-023).

---

## New FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rule Identified

### A-017 — Session Memory Must Not Cite a REJECTION-PACKAGE Session as PASS

**Triggered by**: session-024-20260301 — foreman-v2-agent session-076 session memory recorded
`iaa_audit_token: IAA-session-023-20260301-PASS`. Session-023 issued REJECTION-PACKAGE with
`token_reference: N/A`. The token `IAA-session-023-20260301-PASS` was never issued. Even with
explicit `token_update_ceremony: PENDING` and `integrity_loop: OPEN` notations, referencing a
REJECTION-PACKAGE session's identifier as a PASS token in any artifact is misleading.

**How this differs from A-016**: A-016 catches cross-PR token reuse (same session token cited in
wrong PR's artifacts). A-017 catches same-PR cross-verdict citation (a REJECTION session's token
format cited as PASS, even within the same PR's session memory).

**Why this was not a hard FAIL this session**: The PREHANDOVER proof (primary audit artifact per
CORE-016) correctly used `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`. No fabricated approval appeared in the
primary artifact. The session memory's problematic token had explicit PENDING ceremony notation
that acknowledged the token needs updating. No existing check (A-006, A-016, CORE-016) triggered
on this pattern. However, the pattern is deceptive enough to warrant a permanent rule.

**Permanent Rule**:
When reviewing any session memory `iaa_audit_token` field value:
1. If the format is `IAA-session-NNN-YYYYMMDD-PASS`:
   a. Open `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/memory/session-NNN-YYYYMMDD.md`
   b. Check `verdict` field. If `verdict: REJECTION-PACKAGE` → the token is non-existent. FAIL.
   c. Finding: "Token `IAA-session-NNN-YYYYMMDD-PASS` references session-NNN which issued
      REJECTION-PACKAGE — no such PASS token was ever generated."
   d. Fix: Foreman must update the session memory `iaa_audit_token` to the token issued by the
      most recent IAA invocation that issued ASSURANCE-TOKEN for this PR.
2. This check applies to session memory files, supplementing the PREHANDOVER proof checks of A-016.
3. Explicit `token_update_ceremony: PENDING` notation does NOT exempt from this check — it only
   reduces severity if the PREHANDOVER proof is correctly PENDING. Both must be PENDING, or neither
   should cite a REJECTION session as PASS.

**Status**: ACTIVE — enforced from session-025 onwards
| A-001 (IAA invocation evidence) | YES | PASS — PREHANDOVER proof present; REJECT token referenced; this session IS the invocation |
| A-002 (no class exceptions) | YES | PASS — Foreman-class agent correctly re-invoked; no exemption |
| A-003 (ambiguity resolves to mandatory) | YES | PASS — AMBIGUOUS category → mandatory; Foreman complied |
| A-004 (bootstrap directive) | YES | PASS — agent_bootstrap called first |
| A-005 (no .github/agents/ modifications) | YES | PASS — zero .github/agents/ changes |
| A-006 (INC-IAA-SKIP-001 detection) | YES | PASS — REJECT token ≠ PHASE_A_ADVISORY FABRICATION pattern; verbatim placeholder = legitimate pre-invocation state |
| A-015 (Tier 2 patches require full ceremony) | YES | PASS — N/A to this wave (no Tier 2 patches) |

**fail_only_once_updates**: None this session — the FC-5 fix was correctly applied; no new governance breach pattern requiring a new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule emerged.

---

## Learning Notes

1. **PENDING state is the correct pre-invocation form**: PREHANDOVER proof with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`
   and `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim): [PENDING]` is the legitimate pre-invocation state. IAA should
   not fail CORE-016 on honest PENDING markers when IAA IS being called in that same invocation.
   The INC-IAA-SKIP-001 failure mode is fabrication (fake token or fake advisory); PENDING is
   disclosure, not deception.

2. **Session memory secondary to PREHANDOVER proof for CORE-016**: CORE-016's FAIL condition
   specifically targets the PREHANDOVER proof's iaa_audit_token pattern. The session memory's
   token field is a secondary artifact — important for A-016 cross-PR check, now also subject to
   A-017 cross-verdict check, but not the primary CORE-016 trigger.

3. **All 5 re-invocation findings remediated cleanly**: The foreman-v2-agent correctly identified
   and resolved all 5 session-023 failures. The PREHANDOVER proof pattern (PENDING → update after
   IAA issues token) is now well-established as the correct pre-invocation workflow.

4. **Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN ceremony compliance is critical**: The PREHANDOVER proof and session memory
   must be updated immediately after this ASSURANCE-TOKEN. Two specific fields in each document
   require updating. The OPOJD gate checkbox must also be marked. Foreman must complete this
   ceremony before opening the PR for merge.

5. **Verbatim IAA response population**: S-009 requires the full verbatim IAA output block to be
   pasted character-for-character into the `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section of the
   PREHANDOVER proof. Paraphrasing or summarizing is prohibited per CORE-016 v2.1.0. This session's
   ASSURANCE-TOKEN block must be copied exactly.
1. **Re-invocation iaa_audit_token pattern confirmed**: When a REJECTION-PACKAGE is issued and a fix is applied before re-invocation, the correct iaa_audit_token format for the PREHANDOVER proof during re-invocation is: `IAA-session-NNN-YYYYMMDD-REJECT (first invocation — [fix description] — re-invocation pending)`. This correctly references the real rejection without triggering the A-006 PHASE_A_ADVISORY FABRICATION pattern. The verbatim section placeholder remains acceptable until the ASSURANCE-TOKEN response is pasted. This is the definitive precedent for multi-invocation waves.

2. **Stale narrative counts after fix application (advisory pattern)**: When the FC-5 fix was applied, the PREHANDOVER proof's bundle completeness TABLE was correctly updated (added rows for spec-25 and spec-26), but the OPOJD narrative description ("24 issue spec files") and QP Verdict narrative ("26 artifacts: 24 issue specs + catalog + session memory") were not updated to reflect the new count of 26 specs / 28 total artifacts. This is a recurring risk when fixes are applied mid-wave: the operative sections (bundle completeness table) get updated, but narrative summaries may lag. Future Foreman sessions should update ALL numeric references when adding specs to an existing PREHANDOVER proof. Non-blocking in this instance because the operative table was correct.

3. **FC-5 fix verification is a complete re-audit, not a spot check**: This session fully re-ran all 23 applicable checks — not just the previously-failed FC-5. All prior PASS checks confirmed to still PASS after the fix. This is the correct re-invocation protocol: the entire checklist runs again, not just the delta.

4. **S-005 LOW priority documentation pattern**: issue-spec-26 correctly documents S-005 as LOW priority with explicit justification (the workflow works in practice; this is a quality/coverage improvement). This is the correct pattern for improvements where urgency is genuinely low — the spec should be created (not silently excluded) AND the priority should be accurately set with rationale.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **A-017 — REJECTION-as-PASS citation detection**: Implement A-017 in the Phase 3 checklist
   as an explicit sub-check under CORE-016 or as a standalone FAIL-ONLY-ONCE check from session-025
   onward. This closes the gap where a session memory references a REJECTION session with a PASS
   token format without triggering A-006 or A-016. The check: "If session memory iaa_audit_token
   format is IAA-session-NNN-YYYYMMDD-PASS, verify that session-NNN verdict = ASSURANCE-TOKEN."

2. **PREHANDOVER ceremony post-verdict checklist**: Consider adding an explicit post-verdict
   update checklist to the PREHANDOVER proof template that enumerates exactly what the Foreman
   must update after IAA issues ASSURANCE-TOKEN. This would prevent the integrity loop from
   remaining open (as happened here with session memory `IAA-session-023-20260301-PASS`).

3. **Continuous improvement — re-invocation pattern established**: This is now the second
   successful re-invocation pattern (session-022 resolved session-021 rejection; session-024 resolves
   session-023 rejection). The pattern works: Foreman receives specific REJECTION-PACKAGE with
   N findings, remediates all N, re-invokes IAA, ASSURANCE-TOKEN issued. Document this as a
   positive behavioral loop in the governance system — it demonstrates STOP-AND-FIX mandate
   functioning as intended.
1. **S-019 (NEW)**: PREHANDOVER proof fix-application protocol — when adding new artifacts to an existing PREHANDOVER proof mid-wave (e.g., after a REJECTION-PACKAGE fix), the Foreman should run a find-and-replace on ALL numeric references (issue spec count, total artifact count) throughout the proof, not just update the bundle completeness table. Suggest adding a "Proof Consistency Check" step to the post-fix checklist: verify that all numeric artifact counts in narrative sections match the bundle completeness table row count.

2. **Continuous improvement**: The re-invocation ceremony worked exactly as designed in this session. The Foreman: (a) correctly received the REJECTION-PACKAGE, (b) applied the specific fix (added specs 25 and 26), (c) updated the iaa_audit_token to reference the rejection, (d) re-invoked IAA. The multi-invocation governance loop is robust. The pattern established in this session (REJECT-token reference + placeholder verbatim section = correct pre-re-invocation state) should be documented in the Foreman Tier 2 knowledge as a canonical re-invocation pattern.
