## Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN Ceremony Mandates

The following items are NOT failures — they are ceremony closure requirements that MUST be
completed before this PR is submitted for CS2 merge review:

1. Paste verbatim IAA output into PREHANDOVER proof `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section
2. Update `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` → `IAA-session-085-20260302-PASS` in PREHANDOVER proof
3. Update `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` → `IAA-session-085-20260302-PASS` in foreman session memory
4. Update PREHANDOVER checklist: `[ ] IAA audit token recorded` → `[x] IAA audit token recorded: IAA-session-085-20260302-PASS`
5. Stage and commit three untracked/modified files to branch:
   - .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-086-iaa-tier2-20260302.md
   - .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-086-iaa-tier2-20260302.md
   - .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md
6. Verify all 9 artifacts from PREHANDOVER bundle completeness table are committed before PR open

## Learning Notes

1. **CORE-007 PENDING carve-out is self-demonstrating**: The first exercise of the CORE-007 v2.3.0 PENDING carve-out is the very PR that introduced it. This is the bootstrap case mentioned in A-015: "A patch to [any] ceremony itself must follow the ceremony it describes — this is the canonical bootstrap case." The PR exercises exactly what it defines.

2. **INC-IAA-SKIP-002 pattern confirmed and closed**: The pattern of committing substantive changes via `report_progress` (or equivalent) before Phase 4 is complete is now codified as A-016 (Foreman registry) and INC-IAA-SKIP-002. The retroactive ceremony mechanism (CORE-016/007 PENDING carve-out) worked correctly — IAA was able to audit the artifacts even though they were created after-the-fact. The key guard is that the substantive CONTENT was correct; only the ceremony was skipped. Had the content been deficient, the retroactive ceremony would have produced a REJECTION-PACKAGE, which is the correct outcome.

3. **Untracked evidence artifacts at audit time**: The PREHANDOVER proof and session memory were untracked at the time of this audit. They were still auditable because they were accessible in the working tree. The Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN ceremony commitment mandate ensures they are committed before merge. Consider whether a future FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule should explicitly address this pattern (evidence present but untracked at audit time) — or whether the current CORE-018 wording adequately handles it via the PENDING carve-out. Current assessment: CORE-018 + CORE-016 PENDING carve-out handle it correctly. No new rule needed.

4. **Rule ID deduplication is governance hygiene**: Having A-016 appear twice created ambiguity in 7+ session citations. The renumbering to A-018/A-019 resolves this cleanly. Future sessions should verify rule ID uniqueness whenever adding new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE entries.

## Suggestions for Improvement

**Mandatory — this field must never be blank:**

**Concrete improvement (CORE-018 ceremony-in-progress wording)**: CORE-018 currently says "Confirm PREHANDOVER proof file exists on the PR branch." The word "on the PR branch" is ambiguous — it could mean (a) committed to the branch HEAD, or (b) present in the working tree of the branch. This ambiguity was navigated in this session via the CORE-016 PENDING carve-out, but the wording of CORE-018 should be updated to explicitly state: "For PENDING mid-ceremony invocations, PREHANDOVER proof present in the working tree of the branch is sufficient — file must be committed as a Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN ceremony mandate before PR merge." This would make the CORE-018 check language unambiguous and prevent future uncertainty about whether untracked ceremony files constitute a CORE-018 failure.

**No degradation observed in content quality.** All 5 knowledge files are substantively correct, internally consistent, and properly versioned.
