---

## Phase 1 Preflight Record

**bootstrap_directive_complied**: YES — agent-bootstrap-agent_bootstrap called as absolute first action (A-004 attested). No repo files read before contract loaded.

**tier2_knowledge_loaded**: YES
- index.md — v1.2.0 — PRESENT (knowledge version confirmed from file)
- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md — v1.2.0 — PRESENT (A-001 through A-017 active; note: two rules carry A-016 and A-004 IDs due to registry duplication — all rules functionally loaded)
- iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md — v2.1.0 — ACTIVE (CORE-001 to CORE-017; copy-paste requirement for CORE-016 per v2.1.0)
- iaa-trigger-table.md — v2.0.0 — ACTIVE (fully populated)
- iaa-category-overlays.md — v2.0.0 — ACTIVE (fully populated)
- session-memory-template.md — v1.0.0 — PRESENT

**tier2_gap_flagged**: MINOR — FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md contains duplicate rule IDs (two rules using A-004 and two rules using A-016). All rules are functionally distinct and loaded. Recommendation: deduplicate in next registry maintenance pass (see Suggestions for Improvement).

**tier1_governance_verified**: PASS
- CANON_INVENTORY.json: 189 canons, 0 null/placeholder hashes — HASH CHECK: PASS
- IAA canon present: YES — INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md in CANON_INVENTORY, hash ca381e11b885704ecd01ff0cddae38d092de89de4d1db1a0ea86291aebf15118

**breach_registry_checked**: NO OPEN BREACHES — all historical entries are advisory (Phase A) and closed
**prior_sessions_reviewed**: session-022, session-023, session-024, session-025, session-026
**open_rejection_packages_from_prior_sessions**: NONE — prior sessions covered different PRs; no open REJECTION-PACKAGEs for copilot/migrate-maturion-persona

**merge_gate_checks_loaded**: 3 checks
- Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict
- Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment
- Merge Gate Interface / stop-and-fix/enforcement

---

## Phase 2 — Alignment

**pr_reviewed**: Wave CL-1 (LKIAC Wave 1 — Maturion Persona Migration) / branch: copilot/migrate-maturion-persona
**invoking_agent**: foreman-v2-agent (session-078)
**producing_agent**: qa-builder (CL-1.1), api-builder (CL-1.2), governance-liaison-isms-agent (CL-1.3)
**producing_agent_class**: builder (qa-builder, api-builder), liaison (governance-liaison-isms-agent)
**independence_check**: CONFIRMED — IAA did not produce any artifact under review
**pr_category**: AAWP_MAT
**iaa_triggered**: YES — `packages/ai-centre/` artifacts match AAWP_MAT trigger pattern
**foreman_builder_mandate**: NOT APPLICABLE — no agent contract files in this PR; AAWP_MAT trigger applies
**ambiguity_check**: CLEAR — category unambiguously AAWP_MAT

## Learning Notes

1. **LKIAC wave pattern validated**: CL-1 used the three-builder delegation pattern (qa-builder RED gate → api-builder implementation → governance-liaison registry update). This worked cleanly and produced zero failures. The pattern is now confirmed as reusable for LKIAC Waves 2–4 which follow the same persona migration structure.

2. **PENDING token protocol confirmed**: The Foreman correctly used `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` with an empty "Awaiting IAA verdict" section in the PREHANDOVER proof, then invoked IAA. This is the correct pre-verdict behavior and correctly passes A-006, CORE-016 checks. The PENDING state is process-compliant — not a fabrication. No new rule needed; this is the documented correct flow.

3. **FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry has duplicate IDs**: Two rules are labeled A-004 (one is the Bootstrap Directive rule, one is the Post-Merge Retrospective rule) and two rules are labeled A-016 (one is the Trigger Table Misapplication rule, one is the Cross-PR Token Reuse rule). All rules are functionally active but the duplicate IDs could cause confusion in future sessions when referencing by ID. Flag for CodexAdvisor to deduplicate in next registry maintenance pass.

4. **GRS-010 documentation drift (pre-existing)**: The test file header comment states "Persona files stored in `packages/ai-centre/agents/`" but the actual PersonaLoader resolves from `packages/ai-centre/src/agents/`. This drift predates CL-1 and was noted by the Foreman as S-010. Not a CL-1 defect but should be corrected in a future maintenance wave.

5. **Domain alignment verification**: `maturion-advisor.md` content was cross-verified against the legacy `apps/maturion-maturity-legacy/src/agents/maturion/prompts/system.md`. Both use the Six Domains framework with the same domains and same compliance framework references (ISO 27001, NIST, ASIS, PCI DSS, SOC 2). The migration preserves semantic equivalence while adding proper AIMC governance wrapper (YAML front-matter, IDLE wiring state, security guardrails section).

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry deduplication** (Phase 1): FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md contains duplicate rule IDs — two entries using A-004 and two entries using A-016. While all rules are functionally distinct and load correctly, the duplicate IDs create potential for ambiguous rule references in future sessions (e.g., "citing A-016" is ambiguous between the Trigger Table Misapplication rule and the Cross-PR Token Reuse rule). Recommend CodexAdvisor renumber the later-added rules to sequential IDs (A-018, A-019, etc.) in next registry maintenance pass.

2. **GRS-010 path correction** (AAWP follow-up / S-010): The test file header comment in `PersonaLoader.test.ts` references `packages/ai-centre/agents/` as the persona storage path, but the actual path is `packages/ai-centre/src/agents/`. This documentation drift should be corrected in a future maintenance PR to prevent confusion in LKIAC Waves 2–4 persona migrations.

To be appended to `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md`:
```
| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-027 | [Phase 1] | FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md has duplicate rule IDs (A-004 appears twice, A-016 appears twice) — recommend deduplication/renumbering to prevent ambiguous references | session-027-20260301.md |
| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-027 | [Phase 3] | GRS-010 doc drift in PersonaLoader.test.ts header comment (references agents/ but actual path is src/agents/) — pre-existing, recommend correction in maintenance wave | session-027-20260301.md |

## Post-Verdict Ceremony Requirements for Foreman

The following actions are REQUIRED by foreman-v2-agent (session-078) after receiving this token:

1. Update `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` → `iaa_audit_token: IAA-session-027-20260301-PASS` in PREHANDOVER proof
2. Paste verbatim IAA Agent Response block (the ASSURANCE-TOKEN block above) into `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section of PREHANDOVER proof (CORE-016 copy-paste requirement)
3. Update `iaa_phase` and `iaa_audit_token` in session-078 memory
4. Mark `integrity_loop: CLOSED` and `token_update_ceremony: COMPLETE`
5. Commit all files to branch (including PREHANDOVER, session memory, and the 3 wave deliverables)
6. Open PR — merge permitted subject to CS2 approval
