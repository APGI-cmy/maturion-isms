## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

```yaml
fail_only_once_rules_applied:
  - rule: A-001
    check: IAA invocation evidence present in PREHANDOVER and session memory
    outcome: PASS — iaa_invoked:true, iaa_tool_called documented, PENDING token correct
  - rule: A-002
    check: No class exemption claim
    outcome: PASS — Foreman correctly invoked IAA without exemption claim
  - rule: A-006
    check: INC-IAA-SKIP-001 pattern detection
    outcome: PASS — iaa_audit_token is PENDING (not PHASE_A_ADVISORY bare date string)
  - rule: A-016
    check: Cross-PR token reuse
    outcome: PASS — N/A (PENDING state; no real session token to cross-reference)
  - rule: A-017
    check: REJECTION-as-PASS citation
    outcome: PASS — N/A (PENDING state)
fail_only_once_updates: none — no new recurring pattern requiring new rule this session
```

## Substance Verification Summary

- **12 components assessed**: DEP-001 through DEP-012 all present in register ✅
- **All files verified**: All 12 legacy component files/paths confirmed present in codebase via filesystem check ✅
- **All ACTIVE status**: Correct — Foreman Office App doesn't exist yet; AIMC Maturion persona not migrated ✅
- **Gap register**: 4 gap items (GAP-001 through GAP-004) for QA dashboards + Data Sources Management ✅
- **CP-3 gate**: CS2 sign-off gate properly structured in §6 ✅
- **POLC boundary**: Foreman delegated to governance-liaison-isms-agent; did not self-implement ✅
- **A-014**: This invocation IS the tool call referenced in session-078 memory ✅

## Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN Ceremony Obligations (MANDATORY before PR open)

The following MUST be completed by foreman-v2-agent before the PR is opened:

1. Add `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section to PREHANDOVER proof and paste verbatim IAA output
2. Update `iaa_audit_token` in PREHANDOVER proof: `PENDING` → `IAA-session-027-20260301-PASS`
3. Update `iaa_audit_token` in session-078 memory: `PENDING — see PREHANDOVER proof` → `IAA-session-027-20260301-PASS`
4. Tick the `[ ] IAA audit token recorded` checklist item in PREHANDOVER proof
5. Commit updated artifacts to branch
6. Open PR

---

## Learning Notes

1. **PREHANDOVER proof missing `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section at invocation time**: Session-078's PREHANDOVER proof had `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` but NO `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section with PENDING marker. In contrast, session-025's PREHANDOVER proof had this section with PENDING marker, which is the established template standard. This is a structural gap vs. the template — the section should exist (with PENDING marker) even at invocation time to make it clear where the verbatim response will be pasted. This did NOT trigger CORE-016 FAIL (the strict FAIL condition requires PHASE_A_ADVISORY pattern AND section absent), but it is a deviation from template best practice. The Foreman should adopt the session-025 template format consistently.

2. **Legacy app scope gap — 40 pages vs 12 LKIAC-001 §6 components**: The `apps/maturion-maturity-legacy/src/pages/` directory contains 40 pages, but LKIAC-001 §6 only defined 12 components for the deprecation register scope. The 28 additional pages include core application functionality (Assessment, Dashboard, Journey, ModulesOverview, AuditStructureConfig, etc.) that are not in the admin/watchdog/knowledge/agent category. The execution plan's stated objective is "Formally complete the Deprecation Register for ALL maturion-maturity-legacy components" — but the exit criteria only requires 12 LKIAC-001 §6 components. This internal inconsistency in the execution plan suggests the scope may need CS2 review. The register §7 provides the correct escalation mechanism for any newly identified components.

3. **All 12 status assessments confirmed correct via direct filesystem verification**: The IAA independently verified all 12 DEP file paths. This is a good practice that strengthens confidence in the register's accuracy. Future LKIAC audits should follow the same pattern.

4. **"TBD" as documented gap content vs. placeholder stub**: The "TBD — no equivalent planned" values in DEP-005/006/007 required judgment. The ruling: TBD in a gap register documenting that no equivalent exists is documented content (the audit finding IS that the target is TBD), not an unfilled stub. This is consistent with the session-025 precedent for PENDING tokens. The broader principle: context determines whether a marker is a stub (incomplete) or content (documented state). Future invocations may apply this distinction.

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **PREHANDOVER proof template should always include `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section with PENDING marker at invocation time**: The session-025 template had this section; session-078's proof omitted it. The template should be enforced so the section always exists (even with PENDING marker) before IAA is called. This makes the Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN Ceremony obligation explicit and reduces the risk of the section being forgotten. Recommend: Foreman add this section to the PREHANDOVER template (PREHANDOVER-template.md) as a required block even at pre-invocation time.

2. **Execution plan internal consistency — CL-3 scope**: The execution plan's Wave CL-3 objective says "ALL maturion-maturity-legacy components" but exit criteria restricts to "12 LKIAC-001 §6 components." These should be reconciled. Recommend: CS2 review whether the 28 additional legacy pages (core application pages) should be covered by a separate LKIAC wave or explicitly noted as out of scope in the execution plan.
