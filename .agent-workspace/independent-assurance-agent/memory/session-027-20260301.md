- adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict: PHASE_B_BLOCKING

---

## Phase 1 Preflight Record

**bootstrap_directive_complied**: YES — agent-bootstrap-agent_bootstrap called as absolute first action (A-004 attested). No repo files read before contract loaded.

**tier2_knowledge_loaded**: YES
- index.md — v1.2.0 — PRESENT
- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md — v1.2.0 — PRESENT (A-001 through A-017 active; duplicate A-016 ID noted — gap for renumbering)
- iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md — v2.1.0 — ACTIVE (CORE-001 to CORE-017; fully populated)
- iaa-trigger-table.md — v2.0.0 — ACTIVE (fully populated)
- iaa-category-overlays.md — v2.0.0 — ACTIVE (fully populated)
- session-memory-template.md — v1.0.0 — PRESENT

**tier2_gap_flagged**: Minor — FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md has two rules carrying ID A-016 (cross-PR token reuse and trigger table misapplication). Renumbering needed but non-blocking.

**tier1_governance_verified**: PASS
- Wake-up protocol: ALL 7 PHASES PASSED (Branch: copilot/perform-legacy-inventory-mapping; 4 uncommitted changes)
- CANON_INVENTORY.json: 189 entries (via `canons` key), 0 null/placeholder hashes — HASH CHECK: PASS
- IAA canon present: YES — INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md — SHA256 ca381e11b885704ecd01ff0cddae38d092de89de4d1db1a0ea86291aebf15118 — independently verified (sha256sum): EXACT MATCH ✅
- AGCFPP-001: confirmed present in CANON_INVENTORY with valid hash
- Note: wake-up script reports "Total artifacts: 0" due to known key mismatch (looks for array root; CANON_INVENTORY uses 'canons' key) — Python verification confirms 189 valid entries

**session_memory_prior_sessions_reviewed**:
- session-022-20260301: ASSURANCE-TOKEN IAA-session-022-20260301-PASS (Tier 2 knowledge patch, copilot/patch-proof-template-update)
- session-023-20260301: ASSURANCE-TOKEN IAA-session-023-20260301-PASS (Wave 12 governance deliverables, foreman session-076)
- session-024-20260301: REJECTION-PACKAGE IAA-024-20260301-REJECT (governance liaison retroactive audit + Wave 12 re-invocation; 4 failures: CORE-013, CORE-016, OVL-CG-001, OVL-CI-002)
- session-025-20260301: REJECTION-PACKAGE IAA-025-20260301-REJECT (governance propagation wave re-invocation #2; 1 failure: OVL-CI-002 self-authorization)
- session-026-20260301: ASSURANCE-TOKEN IAA-session-026-20260301-PASS (governance propagation wave re-invocation #3; all checks PASS)

**unresolved_items_carried_forward**: NONE — all prior session issues resolved. No open REJECTION-PACKAGEs for current PR (first invocation for copilot/perform-legacy-inventory-mapping).

**breach_registry_check**: CLEAR — breach-registry.md shows no open breaches.

## Failures Cited

| Finding ID | Check | Description | Fix Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-001 | CORE-007 / OVL-AM-001 | Two "TBD" placeholder instances in delivered artifacts: (1) CL-2-D1 §4 line 244: "⚠️ CL-5 scope TBD — CS2 to decide"; (2) CL-2-D2 §8 line 177, criteria_chunks domain column: "❌ TBD" | (1) Change to "⚠️ CL-5 scope: CS2 decision required"; (2) Change to "❌ PENDING — deprecated table; live query required". Re-invoke IAA after both changes. |

---

## Advisory Findings (not blocking)

| ID | Type | Description | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| ADV-001 | EC-1 row count gap | CL-2-D1 spec requires "total row count" but actual live row counts unavailable (no live DB access at authoring time). SQL queries provided. | CS2 to run Q1–Q7 from CL-2-D1 §5 against project dmhlxhatogrrrvuruayv. Record actual row counts before CP-2 sign-off. Gates CL-5. |

## Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN Ceremony Obligations (MANDATORY before PR open)

The following MUST be completed by foreman-v2-agent before the PR is opened:

1. Add `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section to PREHANDOVER proof and paste verbatim IAA output
2. Update `iaa_audit_token` in PREHANDOVER proof: `PENDING` → `IAA-session-027-20260301-PASS`
3. Update `iaa_audit_token` in session-078 memory: `PENDING — see PREHANDOVER proof` → `IAA-session-027-20260301-PASS`
4. Tick the `[ ] IAA audit token recorded` checklist item in PREHANDOVER proof
5. Commit updated artifacts to branch
6. Open PR

---

## Learning Notes

1. **PREHANDOVER proof missing `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section at invocation time**: Session-078's PREHANDOVER proof had `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` but NO `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section with PENDING marker. In contrast, session-025's PREHANDOVER proof had this section with PENDING marker, which is the established template standard. This is a structural gap vs. the template — the section should exist (with PENDING marker) even at invocation time to make it clear where the verbatim response will be pasted. This did NOT trigger CORE-016 FAIL (the strict FAIL condition requires PHASE_A_ADVISORY pattern AND section absent), but it is a deviation from template best practice. The Foreman should adopt the session-025 template format consistently.

2. **Legacy app scope gap — 40 pages vs 12 LKIAC-001 §6 components**: The `apps/maturion-maturity-legacy/src/pages/` directory contains 40 pages, but LKIAC-001 §6 only defined 12 components for the deprecation register scope. The 28 additional pages include core application functionality (Assessment, Dashboard, Journey, ModulesOverview, AuditStructureConfig, etc.) that are not in the admin/watchdog/knowledge/agent category. The execution plan's stated objective is "Formally complete the Deprecation Register for ALL maturion-maturity-legacy components" — but the exit criteria only requires 12 LKIAC-001 §6 components. This internal inconsistency in the execution plan suggests the scope may need CS2 review. The register §7 provides the correct escalation mechanism for any newly identified components.

3. **All 12 status assessments confirmed correct via direct filesystem verification**: The IAA independently verified all 12 DEP file paths. This is a good practice that strengthens confidence in the register's accuracy. Future LKIAC audits should follow the same pattern.

4. **"TBD" as documented gap content vs. placeholder stub**: The "TBD — no equivalent planned" values in DEP-005/006/007 required judgment. The ruling: TBD in a gap register documenting that no equivalent exists is documented content (the audit finding IS that the target is TBD), not an unfilled stub. This is consistent with the session-025 precedent for PENDING tokens. The broader principle: context determines whether a marker is a stub (incomplete) or content (documented state). Future invocations may apply this distinction.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **PREHANDOVER proof template should always include `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section with PENDING marker at invocation time**: The session-025 template had this section; session-078's proof omitted it. The template should be enforced so the section always exists (even with PENDING marker) before IAA is called. This makes the Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN Ceremony obligation explicit and reduces the risk of the section being forgotten. Recommend: Foreman add this section to the PREHANDOVER template (PREHANDOVER-template.md) as a required block even at pre-invocation time.

2. **Execution plan internal consistency — CL-3 scope**: The execution plan's Wave CL-3 objective says "ALL maturion-maturity-legacy components" but exit criteria restricts to "12 LKIAC-001 §6 components." These should be reconciled. Recommend: CS2 review whether the 28 additional legacy pages (core application pages) should be covered by a separate LKIAC wave or explicitly noted as out of scope in the execution plan.

## Content Quality Observations

The Wave CL-2 deliverables are of HIGH content quality. Specific positive findings:
1. Schema documentation for all 4 tables is complete and precise — fully migration-derived
2. All 13 legacy labels mapped with confidence ratings and rationale
3. diamond_knowledge_pack correctly identified as UNMAPPABLE and escalated to CS2 with D-5 decision point
4. Extended taxonomy (CL-2-D3) is well-reasoned: ldcs (HIGH urgency), maturity-model (recommended NO), diamond-industry (HIGH urgency), assessment-framework (LOW priority) — all with rationale
5. CS2 decision points D-1 through D-5 are clearly articulated with options and recommendations
6. §9 provides a complete proposed CHECK constraint amendment for CL-5 schema preparation
7. CP-2 sign-off table §10 correctly blocks CL-5 entry pending 7 CS2 approvals
8. Consolidated mapping table §8 is production-ready as a CL-5 migration reference

The REJECTION-PACKAGE is solely for 2 trivial TBD pattern instances (CORE-007). Fixes are cosmetic changes only — no content rework required.

---

## Learning Notes

**L-001 — TBD in table cells**: The most common way CORE-007 triggers on governance documents (not agent contracts) is through table cells where agents naturally write "TBD" for pending CS2 decisions or unknown values. Agents should be trained to use "PENDING — CS2 decision required" or "PENDING — live query required" instead of the prohibited "TBD" pattern. This is a preventable failure.

**L-002 — Spec literal row count vs. operational constraint**: The CL-2-D1 spec requires "total row count" but the agents had no live DB access. The correct handling (which was done) is to document the limitation, provide SQL queries, and escalate to CS2. However, the exit criterion as written ("Legacy row count and schema documented") creates ambiguity about whether PENDING counts satisfy it. Future LKIAC wave specs should explicitly state "row count documented if available; SQL provided if live access unavailable" to eliminate this ambiguity.

**L-003 — FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule ID collision**: The FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry has two rules named A-016 (one for cross-PR token reuse from session-023, one for trigger table misapplication from session-024). This should be renumbered: keep the current A-016 (cross-PR token reuse, chronologically first) and renumber the trigger table misapplication rule as A-018. The current A-017 remains.

---

## Fail-Only-Once Updates

**NO NEW RULES** added this session. L-001 (TBD in table cells) is an existing known pattern — not a first-time failure. The fix protocol is already covered by CORE-007. No new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule required.

Noting: FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule ID collision (two A-016 entries) should be corrected in a future session. Flagged as a gap in this session but not creating a new rule here to avoid compounding the numbering issue.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

**S-001 (Phase 3 CORE-007 TBD prevention)**: The foreman and builder agents should have explicit guidance in their FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry or QP checklist: "Never use 'TBD' in table cells of deliverable documents. Use 'PENDING — CS2 decision required' or 'PENDING — [specific reason]' instead." This would eliminate the most common CORE-007 failure pattern on governance document waves. Recommended addition to foreman-v2 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry.
