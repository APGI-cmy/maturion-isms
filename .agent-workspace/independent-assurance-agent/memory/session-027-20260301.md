## Phase 3 Assurance Record

### Checks Executed

| Check | Verdict | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-001 | FAIL → CORE-013 | No PREHANDOVER proof or IAA token reference in PR artifacts |
| FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-002 | PASS | No class exemption claimed |
| FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-006 | N/A | No PREHANDOVER proof to check; liaison session-029 phase error noted (see learning notes) |
| CORE-001 to CORE-012 | N/A | AGENT_CONTRACT checks — no agent contracts modified |
| CORE-007 | PASS | No STUB/TODO/FIXME/placeholder in deliverable (grep: NONE FOUND) |
| CORE-013 | FAIL | No PREHANDOVER proof on branch; no IAA token reference anywhere; liaison session-029 claims Phase A incorrectly |
| CORE-014 | PASS | No class exemption claimed by Foreman or Liaison |
| CORE-015 | PASS | Governance-liaison session-029 IS in PR bundle (git diff confirms presence) |
| CORE-016 | FAIL | No PREHANDOVER proof → no IAA Agent Response (verbatim) section exists anywhere |
| CORE-017 | PASS | No .github/agents/ modifications in PR diff |
| OVL-AM-001 | PASS | No stub/TODO content in deliverable; all 12 AC items substantively addressed |
| OVL-AM-002 | FAIL | Evidence bundle incomplete: PREHANDOVER proof absent; IAA token absent |
| OVL-AM-003 | PASS | Deliverable correctly references GRS, ARC protocol, AAD, APS, Combined Plan, GAP-007 |

**POSITIVE FINDING (informational):**
Deliverable content is EXCELLENT. governance-liaison-isms produced a comprehensive 782-line, 41KB
specification meeting all acceptance criteria AC-1 through AC-11. AC-12 (CS2 approval) correctly
PENDING. POLC boundary fully respected — zero production code files in diff.

- checks_executed: 20 (17 core + 3 overlay; 10 N/A for AGENT_CONTRACT)
- checks_passed: 7
- checks_failed: 3 (CORE-013, CORE-016, OVL-AM-002 — all share single root cause)
- checks_na: 10

---

## Phase 4 Record

- merge_gate_parity_result: FAIL
  - merge-gate/verdict: FAIL (3 checklist failures: CORE-013, CORE-016, OVL-AM-002)
  - governance/alignment: PASS (CANON_INVENTORY 189 entries, 0 bad hashes; deliverable content correctly aligned; POLC boundary respected)
  - stop-and-fix/enforcement: FAIL (STOP-AND-FIX required: 3 blocking failures)
- verdict: REJECTION-PACKAGE
- token_reference: N/A (REJECTION-PACKAGE — no ASSURANCE-TOKEN issued)
- failures_cited:
  - CORE-013: No PREHANDOVER proof or IAA token reference in PR artifacts. Fix: create and commit PREHANDOVER proof to branch with iaa_audit_token: PENDING, then re-invoke IAA.
  - CORE-016: No PREHANDOVER proof → IAA Agent Response (verbatim) section impossible. Fix: same root fix as CORE-013.
  - OVL-AM-002: Evidence bundle incomplete (missing PREHANDOVER proof + IAA token). Fix: same root fix as CORE-013.
- adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict: PHASE_B_BLOCKING

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

| Rule | Applied | Outcome |
|------|---------|---------|
| A-001 (IAA invocation evidence) | YES | FAIL → CORE-013 triggered — no PREHANDOVER proof, no IAA token reference |
| A-002 (no class exceptions) | YES | PASS — Foreman correctly invoked IAA |
| A-003 (ambiguity → mandatory) | YES | PASS — Foreman correctly identified IAA requirement |
| A-004 (bootstrap first) | YES | PASS — bootstrap was absolute first action |
| A-005 (.github/agents/ immutability) | YES | PASS — no .github/agents/ modifications |
| A-006 (INC-IAA-SKIP-001 detection) | NOTED | No PREHANDOVER proof to check A-006 against; however governance-liaison session-029 incorrectly cited "PHASE_A_ADVISORY — IAA not yet deployed (Phase A)" in session memory — this is a factual error (IAA is PHASE_B_BLOCKING). Foreman correctly overrode this. |
| A-015 (Tier 2 knowledge ceremony) | YES | FAIL → PREHANDOVER proof absent (same as CORE-013) |
| A-016 (cross-PR token reuse) | N/A | No prior token cited |
| A-017 (REJECTION-as-PASS citation) | N/A | No prior token cited |

**fail_only_once_updates**: NONE this session — no new patterns warranting new rules beyond existing A-001/A-015 coverage. However, see learning note on governance-liaison phase mis-declaration (candidate for A-018 if recurring).

---

## Learning Notes

1. **Governance-liaison incorrect phase declaration**: governance-liaison-isms session-029 stated "PHASE_A_ADVISORY — IAA not yet deployed (Phase A)" in its session memory. IAA has been in PHASE_B_BLOCKING for multiple prior sessions. The liaison appears unaware of IAA's current adoption phase. This is the first observation of this specific error pattern in the liaison. The foreman correctly overrode it by invoking IAA. If this pattern recurs (liaison or other agents claiming IAA is in Phase A when it is Phase B), consider A-018: "Agents must not declare IAA adoption phase in their session memory — IAA's phase is authoritative and published in the IAA contract YAML. Any agent session memory claiming PHASE_A_ADVISORY without an actual IAA invocation must be treated as a Phase A FABRICATION equivalent."

2. **Single root cause, three failures**: This is the clearest case yet of one corrective action (create PREHANDOVER proof) resolving all three checklist failures. The PREHANDOVER proof is the master ceremony artifact that links all other ceremony requirements. When it's absent, CORE-013, CORE-016, and OVL-AM-002 (for AAWP_MAT) all fail simultaneously. This reinforces the importance of establishing the PREHANDOVER proof as the first ceremony artifact before any other wave delivery actions.

3. **Deliverable quality high despite process failure**: The governance-liaison produced an excellent, comprehensive spec that fully satisfies all issue acceptance criteria and is structurally ready for CS2 review at CP-5. The REJECTION-PACKAGE is a pure process ceremony failure, not a content quality failure. Future foreman orchestrations of governance-liaison-isms should ensure the PREHANDOVER proof is in place before the liaison begins production work (or at minimum before invoking IAA), so high-quality deliverables don't get blocked on ceremony at the last step.

4. **AAWP_MAT category precedent established**: This is the first session where AAWP_MAT (AIMC programme wave deliverable) was the primary classification. The overlay (OVL-AM-001 through OVL-AM-003) functioned correctly. OVL-AM-002 (evidence bundle) correctly flagged the missing PREHANDOVER proof as an independent finding from the CORE checks, providing useful redundancy.

5. **POLC boundary positive confirmation**: Zero production code files in the PR diff. Foreman → governance-liaison delegation pattern is correct. No POLC violation. This is a clean governance-only delivery.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **Foreman pre-wave PREHANDOVER ceremony checklist**: When a foreman session orchestrates a governance-liaison-isms spec delivery, the PREHANDOVER proof should be created at wave planning time (not post-delivery). The foreman should commit the PREHANDOVER proof with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` BEFORE delegating spec authoring to the liaison, so the ceremony infrastructure is in place before delivery begins. This would prevent the pattern seen here: excellent delivery content blocked by missing ceremony artifact.

2. **governance-liaison-isms contract IAA phase awareness**: The liaison's contract should include a note in its Phase 1 or 4 that it must NOT declare IAA's adoption phase in session memory — IAA's phase is a Tier 1 governance fact declared in the IAA contract YAML, not something the liaison can assess. Adding a note like "Do not assess IAA adoption phase — check with Foreman/IAA for current phase" would prevent incorrect PHASE_A_ADVISORY claims in liaison session memory.

3. **OQ tracking improvement**: The liaison's session memory (and parking station) notes that Open Questions (OQ-001 through OQ-005) in §11 of the spec would benefit from explicit tracking as GitHub issue checklist items for CP-5. This is a content quality improvement: consider making it a standard AAWP_MAT overlay check (OVL-AM-004) that any spec with an "Open Questions" section must have those questions tracked in the triggering issue.

## Parking Station Entries (to be appended)

| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-027 | Phase 4 | Foreman pre-wave PREHANDOVER proof should be created at wave planning time before liaison delivery begins — prevents post-delivery ceremony failure on high-quality content | session-027-20260301.md |
| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-027 | Phase 3 | governance-liaison contract should explicitly prohibit agent-side IAA phase declarations — IAA's phase is authoritative from IAA contract YAML only | session-027-20260301.md |
| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-027 | Phase 3 | AAWP_MAT OVL-AM-004 candidate: spec documents with Open Questions section must have OQs tracked as explicit checklist items in triggering issue for CS2 resolution tracking | session-027-20260301.md |
