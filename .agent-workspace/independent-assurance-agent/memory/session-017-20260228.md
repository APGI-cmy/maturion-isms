## Phase 3 Assurance Work

### FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Checks
- A-001 (IAA invocation evidence): PRESENT — PREHANDOVER proof references IAA audit token (Phase A advisory placeholder; CS2 now properly invoking Phase B). PASS ✅
- A-002 (no-class-exceptions): CONFIRMED — AAWP_MAT category, not an agent contract PR. PASS ✅
- A-003 (ambiguity resolution): CLEAR — no ambiguity about category. PASS ✅
- A-004 (bootstrap first): ATTESTED — bootstrap called as absolute first action. PASS ✅
- A-005 (no .github/agents/ modifications): CONFIRMED — `.github/agents/` files appear in grafted history (5,934 files in HEAD~1) as pre-existing files. Evidence: IAA contract `last_updated: 2026-02-25` (before Wave 9.10 date of 2026-02-28); assurance-token-652 is for Wave 9.3 (unrelated); PREHANDOVER proof does not mention agent contract changes. No Wave 9.10 specific content found in `.github/agents/` files. NOT A VIOLATION. PASS ✅

### Core Invariants Checks
- CORE-001: All 9 deliverables exist at claimed paths — PASS ✅
  - incident-intelligence-advisor.md (27 lines): ✅
  - maturity-roadmap-advisor.md (27 lines): ✅
  - mat-advisor.md (20 lines): ✅
  - isms-navigator.md (22 lines): ✅
  - risk-advisor.md (21 lines): ✅
  - xdetect-advisor.md (21 lines): ✅
  - course-crafter-advisor.md (77 lines): ✅
  - AIMC_PERSONA_LIFECYCLE.md (403 lines): ✅
  - wave9.10-persona-lifecycle.test.ts (730 lines): ✅
- CORE-002: All persona files have correct YAML front-matter (version, last_reviewed, owner, module) — PASS ✅
- CORE-003: YAML front-matter delimiters correct (--- open/close) in all 7 persona files — PASS ✅
- CORE-004: Governance doc has required sections (Purpose, Persona Registry, YAML Front-Matter Schema, Lifecycle, Change Log) — PASS ✅
- CORE-005: Test file has real assertions (42 tests, 0 expect(true).toBe(true) stubs, 0 .skip/.todo) — PASS ✅
- CORE-006: New persona files are content-distinct (not copies) — PASS ✅
- CORE-007: No secrets committed — PASS ✅ (false positive: "password hygiene" is educational content)
- CORE-008: Governance doc is substantive (403 lines, 2,893 words, not a stub) — PASS ✅

### Category Overlay Checks (AAWP_MAT)
- OVERLAY-001: AAWP Wave 9.10 reference in governance doc — PASS ✅
- OVERLAY-002: Gap 5 (§4.5) audit reference in governance doc — PASS ✅
- OVERLAY-003: PersonaLoader loads all new personas (42/42 Wave 9.10 tests GREEN) — PASS ✅

### Check Tally
- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE learning checks: 5 PASS / 0 FAIL
- Core invariants: 8 PASS / 0 FAIL
- Category overlay: 3 PASS / 0 FAIL
- **Total: 16 checks, 16 PASS, 0 FAIL**

## Phase 4 Results

### Merge Gate Parity §4.3

- Check 3 (stop-and-fix/enforcement): All 9 deliverables present, governance doc 403 lines — LOCAL: PASS ✅

## Learning Notes

1. **Grafted history pattern**: Shallow clones / grafted git histories cause ALL repository files to appear as "Added (A)" in the first visible commit. This is a known pattern in Copilot SWE agent PRs. IAA must distinguish between pre-existing files appearing in grafted history vs. genuine new modifications. Evidence-based approach: check file `last_updated` timestamps, commit message relevance to file type, and whether PREHANDOVER proof mentions the files.

2. **Phase A → Phase B transition**: Foreman PREHANDOVER proofs produced while Phase A was considered advisory may contain self-generated "Phase A advisory" IAA tokens. These are acceptable placeholders — the correct Phase B flow is for CS2 to invoke IAA independently after the foreman delivers. The foreman's advisory token is not a substitute for the Phase B ASSURANCE-TOKEN.

3. **Test file structure**: Good practice observed — the Wave 9.10 test file documents which tests were RED before implementation and why (comments like `[RED until incident-intelligence-advisor.md is created]`). This transparency aids IAA verification and confirms genuine TDD discipline.

## fail_only_once_updates

None — no new recurring pattern requiring a new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule. Grafted history pattern (learning note 1) is informational, not a breach pattern.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

Concrete improvement suggestion: The foreman's PREHANDOVER proof template should include an explicit "grafted history scope" note when a PR is based on a large commit with pre-existing files, to help IAA immediately identify which files are genuinely new vs. pre-existing. This would reduce investigation time for A-005 checks from ~5 minutes to ~30 seconds. Suggest foreman-v2-agent add a `scope_declaration` field to the PREHANDOVER proof that explicitly lists only the Wave-specific new/modified files.
