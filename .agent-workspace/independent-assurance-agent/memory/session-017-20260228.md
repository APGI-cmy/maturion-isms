## Merge Gate Parity Detail

All 3 required checks executed locally:

1. **Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict** — LOCAL: PASS ✅
   - YAML syntax validated: python3 yaml.safe_load PASS
   - All 4 enforcement jobs present (agent-contract-diff-report, cs2-authorization-check, actor-authority-check, iaa-assurance-check)
   - No governance regressions; no `.github/agents/` files modified
   - Workflow is additive; no existing checks degraded

2. **Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment** — LOCAL: PASS ✅
   - CANON_INVENTORY: 188 canons, 0 bad hashes
   - IAA canon present and AGCFPP-001 present
   - No placeholder content in workflow or evidence bundle
   - CS2 authorization: Issue #679 confirmed real (authored by APGI-cmy, assigned to Copilot)

3. **Merge Gate Interface / stop-and-fix/enforcement** — LOCAL: PASS ✅
   - No open breaches
   - POLC boundary maintained: CodexAdvisor stayed within class
   - Bundle complete: 3/3 required artifacts present

---

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

- fail_only_once_rules_applied:
  - A-001 (IAA invocation evidence): PRESENT — PREHANDOVER proof contains IAA invocation record. PASS.
  - A-002 (no class exceptions): CONFIRMED — CodexAdvisor invoked IAA; no exemption claimed. PASS.
  - A-003 (ambiguity resolves to mandatory): N/A — category unambiguous. PASS.
  - A-004 (bootstrap): ATTESTED — agent-bootstrap called as absolute first action. PASS.
  - A-005 (agent file immutability): CONFIRMED — git diff shows zero `.github/agents/` files. PASS.

- fail_only_once_updates: NONE — no new patterns warranting new rules observed this session.

## AGCFPP §5 Compliance Assessment

The workflow correctly implements all 4 required checks per AGENT_CONTRACT_FILE_PROTECTION_POLICY.md §5:
1. `cs2-authorization-check` → Check 1: PR description references CS2-approved issue ✅
2. `actor-authority-check` → Check 2: Actor consistent with CodexAdvisor or CS2 ✅
3. `agent-contract-diff-report` → Check 3: Diff report generated for IAA review ✅
4. `iaa-assurance-check` → Check 4: IAA assurance token present ✅

Trigger condition: `paths: '.github/agents/**'` — correct ✅
Failure mode: `exit 1` on all failures — hard blocking ✅

---

## Verdict

- verdict: ASSURANCE-TOKEN
- token_reference: IAA-017-20260228-PASS
- all_checks_pass: true
- merge_permitted: true (subject to CS2 approval)

## Learning Notes

1. **CANON_INVENTORY key**: `canons` (not `files` or `artifacts`). Python3 check using `data.get('files', ...)` returns empty; must use `data.get('canons', [])`. Store this key name for future hash verification checks.

2. **CI_WORKFLOW category for new-file-only PRs**: When a PR only creates a new `.github/workflows/` file (no modification to existing workflows or agent contracts), the CI_WORKFLOW overlay checks (OVL-CI-001 to -003) are essentially about ensuring no existing gates are weakened. For a purely additive workflow creation, all three pass trivially. The substantive check is whether the workflow correctly implements its stated policy requirement (AGCFPP §5) — this should be an explicit additional check in future CI_WORKFLOW invocations.

3. **CodexAdvisor 'REVIEW' IAA trigger annotation**: When CodexAdvisor marks IAA as 'REVIEW' (rather than 'YES'), this reflects the agent's own classification — it is not an exemption claim. As long as IAA was actually invoked, this annotation is acceptable. No FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule needed; observe going forward.

4. **Character count discrepancy**: PREHANDOVER stated 20,335 chars; actual file is 21,231 bytes. This is a minor discrepancy (char vs byte count, or measurement at different points in authoring). Not material for a workflow file (no 30K char limit applies). Note for future: PREHANDOVER character counts for non-agent-contract files are informational only.

5. **Self-referential workflow**: The `iaa-assurance-check` job (Job 4) checks for IAA tokens in IAA session memory. The current invocation creates an IAA session memory file with ASSURANCE-TOKEN. If this PR were for an agent contract, Job 4 would require the IAA token to be present BEFORE CI runs. Since the workflow only triggers on `.github/agents/**` changes, this circular dependency doesn't apply to this PR itself.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

The CI_WORKFLOW overlay (OVL-CI-001 to -003) addresses gate preservation but does not include a substantive correctness check for the new workflow's implementation. For future CI_WORKFLOW IAA invocations where a new workflow is being CREATED (not just modified), the overlay should include an explicit check: "OVL-CI-004: New workflow correctly implements its stated policy requirement per its authority reference." This would formalize the AGCFPP §5 compliance check that was performed informally this session. Recommend adding OVL-CI-004 to iaa-category-overlays.md in a future CS2-authorized governance update.
