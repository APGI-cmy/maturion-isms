## Phase 1 Preflight Record

**bootstrap_directive_complied**: YES — agent-bootstrap-agent_bootstrap called as absolute first action (A-004 attested). No repo files read before contract loaded.

**tier2_knowledge_loaded**: YES
- index.md — v1.2.0 — PRESENT
- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md — v1.2.0 — PRESENT (A-001 through A-006 active)
- iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md — v2.1.0 — ACTIVE (NOTE: this is the file being patched by the PR under review; loaded from working tree as part of review)
- iaa-trigger-table.md — v2.0.0 — ACTIVE
- iaa-category-overlays.md — v2.0.0 — ACTIVE
- session-memory-template.md — v1.0.0 — PRESENT

**tier2_gap_flagged**: NO — all files present and active

**canon_inventory_check**: PASS
- Total canons: 188
- Bad hashes: 0
- IAA canon present: YES (INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md, hash: de6736685706f7c905bb29db922be53f1f66be64ab5743f002d3221b754d84c9)
- AGCFPP-001 present: YES

**wake_up_protocol**: PASS — all 7 phases passed (note: wake-up protocol reports "Total artifacts: 0" due to key mismatch — it looks for top-level array but CANON_INVENTORY uses 'canons' key; Python verification confirmed 188 valid entries)

**session_memory_prior_sessions**:
- session-016-20260227 — ASSURANCE-TOKEN (CI/CD pipeline)
- session-017-20260228 — ASSURANCE-TOKEN (multiple)
- session-018-20260228 — ASSURANCE-TOKEN
- session-019-20260228 — REJECTION-PACKAGE IAA-019-20260228-REJECT (stub population PR, CORE-016 wrong format)
- session-019-20260301 — ASSURANCE-TOKEN
- session-020-20260228 — ASSURANCE-TOKEN (stub population PR final pass)

**open_rejection_packages_from_prior_sessions**: NONE

---

## Phase 2 Alignment Record

- pr_reviewed: copilot/patch-proof-template-update — Tier 2 knowledge patch (prehandover-template.md v1.1.0 + iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md v2.1.0)
- invoking_agent: CodexAdvisor-agent (session-038-20260301)
- producing_agent: CodexAdvisor-agent (session-038-20260301)
- producing_agent_class: overseer
- independence_check: CONFIRMED — IAA did not produce these changes
- pr_category: CANON_GOVERNANCE (closest match; AMBIGUITY RULE applied — governance-affecting Tier 2 knowledge files)
- iaa_triggered: YES — governance knowledge update; ambiguity rule applied
- class_exemption_claim: NONE — CodexAdvisor correctly invoked IAA

---

## Phase 3 Assurance Record

**checks_executed**: 15 (CORE-001 to 012 excluded — not AGENT_CONTRACT; CORE-005, 006, 007, 013, 014, 015, 016, 017 evaluated; overlays OVL-CG-001 to 004 evaluated; FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-001, A-002, A-006 evaluated)
**checks_passed**: 12
**checks_failed**: 3

### Failures:

**CORE-013 FAIL**: No PREHANDOVER proof or IAA token reference in PR artifacts. Branch contains only two modified knowledge files (unstaged). CodexAdvisor session-038 PREHANDOVER proof does not exist. FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-001 triggered.
Fix: Create PREHANDOVER proof with iaa_audit_token: PENDING, commit to branch, re-invoke IAA.

**CORE-015 FAIL**: No session memory artifact in PR bundle. No session-038 session memory file found in CodexAdvisor workspace.
Fix: Create session-038-20260301.md session memory, reference in PREHANDOVER proof.

**CORE-016 FAIL**: No PREHANDOVER proof on branch — therefore no ## IAA Agent Response (verbatim) section. Cannot verify IAA tool call evidence.
Fix: After ASSURANCE-TOKEN issued on re-invocation, paste verbatim block into proof, commit, open PR.

### Content Assessment (acceptance criteria — NOTE: ALL PASS):
- AC1: iaa_audit_token: PENDING as starting value — PASS ✅ (diff confirmed)
- AC2: Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN ceremony steps numbered — PASS ✅ (3 steps added)
- AC3: Anti-misuse guidance present — PASS ✅ (HTML comments + anti-misuse rules)
- AC4: Version bumped to v1.1.0 — PASS ✅
- AC5: iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md v2.1.0 with copy-paste-only rule — PASS ✅

The content changes are correct. Failures are process-only.

## Phase 4 Verdict Record

**merge_gate_parity_result**: FAIL — merge-gate/verdict, governance/alignment, stop-and-fix/enforcement all failed locally due to CORE-013/015/016 process failures
**verdict**: REJECTION-PACKAGE
**token_reference**: IAA-session-021-20260301-REJECT
**failures_cited**:
1. CORE-013 — No PREHANDOVER proof or IAA token reference. Fix: Create PREHANDOVER proof with PENDING token, commit, re-invoke.
2. CORE-015 — No session memory artifact. Fix: Create session-038 memory file, reference in proof.
3. CORE-016 — No PREHANDOVER proof on branch. Fix: After ASSURANCE-TOKEN, paste verbatim block, commit, open PR.

**adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict**: PHASE_B_BLOCKING

## Learning Notes

**Primary learning**: A Tier 2 knowledge patch (non-AGENT_CONTRACT PR) still requires a PREHANDOVER proof + session memory to satisfy CORE-013/015/016. The invoking agent (CodexAdvisor) skipped the PREHANDOVER proof creation step and invoked IAA directly with only the content changes. The very patch being reviewed introduces the PENDING starting token pattern and the Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN Ceremony — CodexAdvisor must apply these to itself as the first use case.

**Irony note**: This PR's stated purpose is to fix exactly the process gap that caused session-018/019 REJECTION-PACKAGEs (missing/incorrect PREHANDOVER proof). The content is correct but the process still violated CORE-013/015/016. The fix instructions should be well-understood given the PR's subject matter.

**Pattern observed**: Tier 2 knowledge patches require the same PREHANDOVER process as other governed PRs. There is no class of PR (by content type) that is exempt from CORE-013/015/016 when IAA is triggered. This is a recurring pattern: every REJECTION-PACKAGE involving CORE-016 has been because the PREHANDOVER proof was either absent or incorrectly populated.

**wake-up protocol gap**: The wake-up protocol reports CANON_INVENTORY "Total artifacts: 0" because it looks for a top-level array but the file uses a 'canons' key. This is a pre-existing observation (seen in prior sessions). Non-blocking but worth noting for future canon tool updates.

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

**Concrete improvement**: The FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry should add a rule A-015 (or similar) explicitly stating: "Tier 2 knowledge patch PRs require PREHANDOVER proof + session memory exactly as AGENT_CONTRACT PRs do — no content-type-based exemption from CORE-013/015/016." This would prevent future invoking agents from assuming that a 'simpler' knowledge patch doesn't need the full PREHANDOVER ceremony. The circular situation here (patching the template that defines the ceremony, without following the ceremony) should be explicitly documented as a known bootstrap pattern: even a patch to the PREHANDOVER template must be treated with the same ceremony it describes.

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

| Rule | Applied | Outcome |
|------|---------|---------|
| A-001 (invocation evidence mandatory) | YES | FAIL → REJECTION-PACKAGE |
| A-002 (no class exceptions) | YES | PASS — no exemption claimed |
| A-006 (INC-IAA-SKIP-001 detection) | YES | PASS — genuine invocation |

**fail_only_once_updates**: Considering A-015 addition (see Suggestions). Not yet formally added — flagging for CS2 consideration.

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Updates This Session

**fail_only_once_updates**:
- A-015 ADDED: "Tier 2 Knowledge Patches Require Full PREHANDOVER Ceremony — No Content-Type Exemption"
  Triggered by: session-021-20260301 REJECTION-PACKAGE (maturion-isms#699)
  Recurring pattern: sessions 018, 019, 021 all had REJECTION-PACKAGEs for CORE-013/015/016 process violations.
  A-015 formalizes that NO content-type exemption from PREHANDOVER ceremony exists for triggered PRs.
