## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

| Rule | Applied | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| A-001 (IAA invocation evidence must be present) | YES | PASS — IAA IS being invoked now by foreman (current session). However, no PREHANDOVER proof with iaa_audit_token: PENDING pre-exists on branch. Content check PASS; ceremony check FAIL (see CORE-013) |
| A-002 (no class exceptions) | YES | PASS — no exemption claimed |
| A-006 (PHASE_A_ADVISORY FABRICATION detection) | YES | PASS — governance-liaison session-030 has `PHASE_A_ADVISORY — IAA not yet deployed` but this is liaison session memory, NOT a PREHANDOVER proof. A-006 targets PREHANDOVER proofs specifically. Not triggered. Factual error noted as ADV-001 below. |
| A-016 (cross-PR token reuse) | YES | PASS — no real session token cited in any PR artifact for this wave |
| A-017 (REJECTION-as-PASS citation) | YES | PASS — no PASS token cited |
| A-015 (Tier 2 knowledge patch requires PREHANDOVER) | YES | FAIL — this is AAWP_MAT (same principle applies): no PREHANDOVER proof on branch → CORE-013 FAIL |

## Core Invariants Check Results

**CORE-001 through CORE-012**: N/A — not AGENT_CONTRACT category (these are AGENT_CONTRACT-specific checks)

**CORE-006**: CANON_INVENTORY alignment
- Evidence: IAA's expected_artifacts (CANON_INVENTORY.json + IAA_CANON.md) both verified ✅
- Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-007**: No placeholder content
- Evidence: Searched all 3 deliverable files for TBD/STUB/TODO/FIXME/placeholder. Zero matches.
- Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-013**: IAA invocation evidence — PREHANDOVER proof or IAA token reference in PR artifacts
- Evidence: Staged files: governance-liaison session-030, persona file, test file, AIMC doc. NO PREHANDOVER proof present. The liaison session-030 has `iaa_audit_token: PHASE_A_ADVISORY — IAA not yet deployed` which is NOT a real IAA token reference. Per A-015 + CORE-013, a PREHANDOVER proof with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` must exist on the branch BEFORE IAA is invoked.
- Verdict: **FAIL ❌**
- Finding: No PREHANDOVER proof artifact on branch `copilot/decouple-agent-evidence-artifacts`. Expected artifact with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` absent. Liaison session-030's self-certified `PHASE_A_ADVISORY` is not a valid IAA token reference.
- Fix: Foreman must create `PREHANDOVER_PROOF_WAVE_CL1.md` (or equivalent) at repo root with standard fields including `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`. Commit to branch. Re-invoke IAA.

**CORE-014**: No class exemption claim
- Evidence: No exemption claimed in any artifact.
- Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-015**: Session memory artifact in PR bundle
- Evidence: Governance-liaison session-030 is present in staged files. However, CORE-015 requires the session memory file path to be present in the PREHANDOVER proof or PR artifact manifest. No PREHANDOVER proof exists. Dependent on CORE-013 failure.
- Verdict: **FAIL ❌**
- Finding: No PREHANDOVER proof exists to formally reference the session memory artifact in the PR bundle.
- Fix: PREHANDOVER proof creation (same fix as CORE-013) will resolve this.

**CORE-016**: IAA tool call evidenced — PREHANDOVER proof must contain `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section
- Evidence: No PREHANDOVER proof on branch. Cannot verify verbatim IAA response section.
- Verdict: **FAIL ❌**
- Finding: No PREHANDOVER proof on branch. The required `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section cannot exist without the proof document.
- Fix: After foreman creates PREHANDOVER proof, re-invokes IAA, and receives ASSURANCE-TOKEN, foreman must update the proof with verbatim IAA output in the `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section.

**CORE-017**: No .github/agents/ modifications by unauthorized agent
- Evidence: No `.github/agents/` files in staged diff. New file is at `packages/ai-centre/src/agents/maturion-advisor.md` (application path, not governance agent path).
- Verdict: PASS ✅

---

## AAWP_MAT Overlay Check Results

**OVL-AM-001**: Stub population complete — no stub/TODO content
- Evidence: Zero TBD/STUB/TODO/FIXME matches across all 3 deliverables. ✅
- Verdict: PASS ✅

**OVL-AM-002**: Evidence artifacts present — required bundle complete
- Evidence: No PREHANDOVER proof on branch. Governance-liaison session-030 present. Required PREHANDOVER proof absent.
- Verdict: **FAIL ❌** (dependent on CORE-013/015/016 failure)

**OVL-AM-003**: Governance alignment — deliverables align with current canon version
- Evidence: AIMC_PERSONA_LIFECYCLE.md references LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0, four-phase canonical v3.2.0, APS §5. Correct.
- Verdict: PASS ✅

---

## Merge Gate Parity Check (§4.3)

| Check | Local Result |
|---|---|
| Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict | FAIL — REJECTION-PACKAGE issued; merge blocked |
| Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment | FAIL — PREHANDOVER ceremony incomplete (CORE-013, 015, 016) |
| Merge Gate Interface / stop-and-fix/enforcement | PASS — STOP-AND-FIX active; all failures cited |

Parity result: FAIL — 2/3 checks fail locally. REJECTION-PACKAGE issued.

---

## Advisory Findings (non-blocking, must be corrected alongside ceremony fix)

**ADV-001**: Governance-liaison session-030 states `IAA Invocation Result: PHASE_A_ADVISORY — IAA not yet deployed`. This is factually incorrect — PHASE_B_BLOCKING has been active since session-028 (2026-03-01). The liaison appears to have written this session before the foreman invoked IAA. When the foreman creates the PREHANDOVER proof and re-invokes IAA, the liaison session-030 should be updated (or a note added) to reflect that Phase B is active and IAA was subsequently invoked by the Foreman as the next step.

---

## Verdict

- verdict: REJECTION-PACKAGE
- token_reference: N/A
- merge_gate_parity_result: FAIL (governance/alignment, merge-gate/verdict)
- adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict: PHASE_B_BLOCKING

---

## Fail-Only-Once Updates

NO NEW RULES added this session. The missing PREHANDOVER proof pattern is already covered by A-015 and CORE-013/015/016. The pattern of invoking IAA directly without first creating the PREHANDOVER proof is a known A-015 pattern. No new governance failure pattern observed.

---

## Learning Notes

**L-001**: This is the second wave (after session-021 for the Tier 2 knowledge patch) where IAA was invoked before the PREHANDOVER ceremony was completed. A-015 covers this pattern. The content of the deliverables was CORRECT — all 3 artifacts meet every specification. The only failures are ceremony-related (missing PREHANDOVER proof). The STOP-AND-FIX for this REJECTION-PACKAGE is minimal: create PREHANDOVER proof, re-invoke IAA. Expected outcome: immediate ASSURANCE-TOKEN on re-invocation.

**L-002**: It may be worth the foreman adding a step in their own FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry that explicitly requires creating the PREHANDOVER proof BEFORE calling IAA (not after). The ordering constraint — PREHANDOVER first, IAA second — is sometimes inverted when the foreman assumes ceremony can be deferred.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

**S-001**: The foreman's FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry should contain a rule (if not already present) stating: "PREHANDOVER proof must be created and committed to branch BEFORE invoking IAA. IAA cannot verify the ceremony retroactively." This would prevent the PREHANDOVER-after-IAA ordering error pattern.

**S-002**: When deliverable content is FULLY CORRECT but ceremony is missing, the REJECTION-PACKAGE's fix section should be structured as a "lightweight ceremony fix" — creating only the PREHANDOVER proof document with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` and re-invoking IAA. The foreman should be able to resolve this within one short session.
