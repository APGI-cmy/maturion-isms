---

## Invocation Context
- pr_reviewed: Wave CL-3-D2 — LKIAC Deprecation Register Gap Resolution (branch: copilot/orchestrate-resolution-deprecation-gaps, foreman-v2-agent session-079)
- invoking_agent: foreman-v2-agent (session-079)
- producing_agent: foreman-v2-agent (orchestration/planning) + governance-liaison-isms-agent (document production)
- producing_agent_class: foreman + liaison-builder
- open_rejection_packages_for_this_pr: none — first IAA invocation for this branch

---

## Classification
- pr_category: AMBIGUOUS (resolved to mandatory invocation per A-003)
- classification_rationale: Governance programme documents in `governance/aimc/` and `governance/EXECUTION/` — not strictly CANON_GOVERNANCE (not governance/canon/ files), not AGENT_CONTRACT, not CI_WORKFLOW, not AAWP_MAT by path. Not unambiguously doc-only (these are execution-controlling governance documents affecting deprecation lifecycle and wave sequencing). AMBIGUITY RULE applied → IAA mandatory. Foreman correctly invoked IAA proactively per A-014.
- ambiguity_rule_applied: YES — category AMBIGUOUS, resolved to mandatory invocation (A-003)
- foreman_builder_mandate_applied: NOT APPLICABLE (no agent contract changes in this PR)

---

## Checks Executed
- checks_executed: 25
- fail_only_once_checks: 7
- core_invariants_checks: 8 (ALL-scope checks: CORE-005, 006, 007, 013, 014, 015, 016, 017)
- category_overlay_checks: 4 (CANON_GOVERNANCE overlay applicable to governance docs: OVL-CG-001 through 004)
- specific_audit_item_checks: 6 (per invocation request §1–§6)

## Post-Verdict Ceremony Obligations

The following obligations apply to foreman-v2-agent BEFORE opening the PR:

1. Paste this verbatim IAA response into `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-079-waveCL3D2-20260301.md` `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section — copy-paste only, no paraphrase.
2. Update `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` → `iaa_audit_token: IAA-session-029-20260301-PASS`
3. Mark `[x] IAA audit token recorded` in PREHANDOVER checklist.
4. Commit ALL working-tree changes (governance docs + PREHANDOVER proof updated with token + session memory) in a single commit or clean PR state.
5. Then open the PR. Not before.

## fail_only_once_updates

None added this session. All patterns observed were compliant. Foreman's execution of Wave CL-3-D2 represents a fully compliant pre-commit ceremony: correct PENDING token, S-009 section present, OPOJD PASS recorded, session memory with suggestions, POLC boundary maintained. No new breach pattern observed.

---

## Learning Notes

1. **AMBIGUOUS category + proactive IAA invocation is the correct pattern**: When governance programme documents (not strictly canon, not agent contracts) are produced, the correct Foreman action is to invoke IAA proactively (A-014 compliant) even if the trigger category is technically ambiguous. Foreman session-079 executed this correctly. This is a positive pattern to note.

2. **Documentation-only waves still require full ceremony**: Despite being a documentation-only wave, the Foreman correctly followed the full PREHANDOVER ceremony (OPOJD check, §4.3 parity, S-009 section, PENDING token, session memory with suggestions). This is the expected standard and should be reinforced in future sessions.

3. **GAP resolution quality: acceptance criteria specificity matters**: The four acceptance criteria in this wave are exemplary — all include specific, testable elements (named Edge Functions, quantified signal sources "≥2", explicit sub-view naming). Future gap resolution waves should reference this session as a quality benchmark.

4. **CL-3.5 RED gate ordering is explicitly sequenced**: The wave definition explicitly names `qa-builder` must produce D1 (failing tests) BEFORE `schema-builder` creates D2 and BEFORE `api-builder` begins D3. This explicit sequencing is governance-correct and prevents the "build before RED gate" anti-pattern.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

**Suggestion S-030-001** (this session): The LKIAC execution plan's AMBIGUOUS trigger category creates a recurring question for IAA about whether to apply CANON_GOVERNANCE or AMBIGUOUS classification. Future improvement: the trigger table should explicitly list `governance/EXECUTION/` and `governance/aimc/` governance programme documents as triggering CANON_GOVERNANCE (or a new GOVERNANCE_PROGRAMME category) to eliminate the ambiguity. This would remove the need to apply A-003 for a well-understood pattern.

*This suggestion has been appended to the Parking Station.*
