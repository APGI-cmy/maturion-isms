**tier2_gap_flagged**: NO — all files present and active at correct versions. Duplicate A-016 ID in FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md is a known non-blocking gap (noted in session-027/028).

**tier1_governance_verified**: PASS
- Wake-up protocol: ALL 5 PHASES PASSED (Branch: copilot/orchestrate-resolution-deprecation-gaps, 2 untracked files — Foreman PREHANDOVER and session memory in pre-commit state)
- CANON_INVENTORY.json: 189 entries (via `canons` list key), 0 null/placeholder hashes — HASH CHECK: PASS
- IAA canon present: YES — INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md — SHA256 ca381e11b885... — confirmed in CANON_INVENTORY ✅
- AGCFPP-001: confirmed present (AGENT_CONTRACT_FILE_PROTECTION_POLICY.md hash 77f14bc5cb1e...)
- HALT-002 condition: NOT triggered (no null/placeholder hashes)

**session_memory_catchup**: COMPLETE
- Sessions reviewed: session-024 (ASSURANCE-TOKEN, Wave 12), session-025 (ASSURANCE-TOKEN, Wave 12 Amendment), session-026 (ASSURANCE-TOKEN), session-027 (ASSURANCE-TOKEN Wave CL-3 + REJECTION-PACKAGE Wave CL-2), session-028 (ASSURANCE-TOKEN Wave CL-2 RE-INVOCATION)
- All prior REJECTION-PACKAGEs resolved: YES (session-027 CL-2 resolved in session-028)

**fail_only_once_registry**: LOADED — A-001 through A-017 (17 rules; duplicate A-016 ID non-blocking gap)

- A-002: ATTESTED
- breach_registry_open_items: NONE (all prior breaches Phase A advisory — ADVISORY RECORDED)

---

## Invocation Context
- pr_reviewed: Wave CL-3-D2 — LKIAC Deprecation Register Gap Resolution (branch: copilot/orchestrate-resolution-deprecation-gaps, foreman-v2-agent session-079)
- invoking_agent: foreman-v2-agent (session-079)
- producing_agent: foreman-v2-agent (orchestration/planning) + governance-liaison-isms-agent (document production)
- producing_agent_class: foreman + liaison-builder
- open_rejection_packages_for_this_pr: none — first IAA invocation for this branch

---

## Classification
- pr_category: AMBIGUOUS (resolved to mandatory invocation per A-003)
- classification_rationale: Governance programme documents in `governance/aimc/` and `governance/EXECUTION/` — not strictly CANON_GOVERNANCE (not governance/canon/ files), not AGENT_CONTRACT, not CI_WORKFLOW, not AAWP_MAT by path. Not unambiguously doc-only (these are execution-controlling governance documents affecting deprecation lifecycle and wave sequencing). AMBIGUITY RULE applied → IAA mandatory. Foreman correctly invoked IAA proactively per A-014.
- ambiguity_rule_applied: YES — category AMBIGUOUS, resolved to mandatory invocation (A-003)
- foreman_builder_mandate_applied: NOT APPLICABLE (no agent contract changes in this PR)

---

## Checks Executed
- checks_executed: 25
- fail_only_once_checks: 7
- core_invariants_checks: 8 (ALL-scope checks: CORE-005, 006, 007, 013, 014, 015, 016, 017)
- category_overlay_checks: 4 (CANON_GOVERNANCE overlay applicable to governance docs: OVL-CG-001 through 004)
- specific_audit_item_checks: 6 (per invocation request §1–§6)

## fail_only_once_updates

None added this session. All patterns observed were compliant. Foreman's execution of Wave CL-3-D2 represents a fully compliant pre-commit ceremony: correct PENDING token, S-009 section present, OPOJD PASS recorded, session memory with suggestions, POLC boundary maintained. No new breach pattern observed.

---

## Learning Notes

1. **AMBIGUOUS category + proactive IAA invocation is the correct pattern**: When governance programme documents (not strictly canon, not agent contracts) are produced, the correct Foreman action is to invoke IAA proactively (A-014 compliant) even if the trigger category is technically ambiguous. Foreman session-079 executed this correctly. This is a positive pattern to note.

2. **Documentation-only waves still require full ceremony**: Despite being a documentation-only wave, the Foreman correctly followed the full PREHANDOVER ceremony (OPOJD check, §4.3 parity, S-009 section, PENDING token, session memory with suggestions). This is the expected standard and should be reinforced in future sessions.

3. **GAP resolution quality: acceptance criteria specificity matters**: The four acceptance criteria in this wave are exemplary — all include specific, testable elements (named Edge Functions, quantified signal sources "≥2", explicit sub-view naming). Future gap resolution waves should reference this session as a quality benchmark.

4. **CL-3.5 RED gate ordering is explicitly sequenced**: The wave definition explicitly names `qa-builder` must produce D1 (failing tests) BEFORE `schema-builder` creates D2 and BEFORE `api-builder` begins D3. This explicit sequencing is governance-correct and prevents the "build before RED gate" anti-pattern.
**bootstrap_directive_complied**: YES — agent-bootstrap-agent_bootstrap called as absolute first action before any repo file read (A-004 attested). No repo files read before contract loaded.

**tier2_knowledge_loaded**: YES
- index.md — v1.2.0 — PRESENT (knowledge_version: 1.2.0)
- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md — v1.2.0 — PRESENT (A-001 through A-017 active; duplicate A-016 ID gap noted from session-027 — non-blocking)

## Post-Verdict Mandatory Conditions

The following conditions MUST be met by the Foreman BEFORE opening the PR:

1. Update PREHANDOVER proof iaa_audit_token: IAA-session-029-20260301-PASS
2. Paste verbatim IAA response in PREHANDOVER ## IAA Agent Response (verbatim) section
3. Write Foreman session memory session-079-waveCL5-amendment-20260301.md with IAA token
4. Commit all pending artifacts:
   - governance/aimc/AIMC_KNOWLEDGE_UPLOAD_CENTRE_SPECIFICATION.md (staged)
   - .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-079-waveCL5-amendment-20260301.md (untracked)
   - .agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/memory/session-030-20260301.md (untracked)
   - .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-079-waveCL5-amendment-20260301.md (to be written)

---

## Advisory Findings (Non-Blocking)

1. **AC-12 internal inconsistency**: §12 Acceptance Criteria item AC-12 reads "PENDING CS2 REVIEW" but the document header says APPROVED and §13 confirms CP-5 COMPLETE. This inconsistency was noted by builder (session-030 suggestion #1). Recommended: update AC-12 to confirm CP-5 complete. Does not block merge — CORE-007 keyword list does not match "PENDING CS2 REVIEW."

2. **Builder session memory adoption phase error**: governance-liaison-isms session-030 states "PHASE_A_ADVISORY — IAA not yet deployed. Proceeding under advisory mode." This is factually incorrect — we are in PHASE_B_BLOCKING. The builder should reference the current adoption phase. This does not trigger A-006 (A-006 checks PREHANDOVER `iaa_audit_token` field, not builder session narrative). Non-blocking for this verdict.

---

## Learning Notes

1. **AMBIGUOUS category confirmation**: `governance/aimc/` governance specs that are NOT in `governance/canon/` and NOT agent contracts correctly fall under the AMBIGUOUS category (not CANON_GOVERNANCE strictly, not EXEMPT). The AMBIGUITY RULE correctly triggers mandatory IAA invocation for these artifacts. Foreman's decision to invoke IAA was correct.

2. **Builder adoption-phase misstatement pattern**: governance-liaison-isms session-030 claimed PHASE_A_ADVISORY in a PHASE_B_BLOCKING era. This is the second time a builder/specialist agent has stated an incorrect adoption phase in session memory (see also session-027 learning on trigger table misapplication by governance-liaison-isms). Consider adding FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule: builder session memory claiming PHASE_A_ADVISORY when PHASE_B is active should be flagged as a non-blocking finding, surfaced in IAA verdict, and recommended for correction. This prevents stale advisory-mode thinking from propagating.

3. **CANON_INVENTORY scope clarification**: CANON_INVENTORY tracks only `governance/canon/` files, not all governance artifacts. OVL-CG-001 (CANON_INVENTORY updated) is N/A for governance specs in `governance/aimc/`, `governance/aimc/`, etc. This scope boundary should be noted in the CANON_GOVERNANCE overlay description to prevent future ambiguity.

4. **SHA256 integrity check value**: Builder correctly recorded the spec SHA256 in session memory. IAA independently verified it. This is a good practice that should be encouraged for all governance spec waves.

5. **Pre-commit invocation pattern is correct**: Foreman used `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` in the PREHANDOVER and invoked IAA before committing. This is the correct A-006/A-014 compliant pattern. Verified clean for INC-IAA-SKIP-001.

---

## Fail-Only-Once Updates

No new rules added this session. Builder adoption-phase misstatement pattern noted above. If this pattern recurs in session-030 or subsequent sessions, a new rule should be added: "Builder session memory must not claim an incorrect adoption phase (PHASE_A_ADVISORY when PHASE_B_BLOCKING is active)."

```yaml
fail_only_once_updates: none_this_session
recurring_pattern_check: none_triggering_new_rule (pattern noted for monitoring)
```

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

**Suggestion S-030-001** (this session): The LKIAC execution plan's AMBIGUOUS trigger category creates a recurring question for IAA about whether to apply CANON_GOVERNANCE or AMBIGUOUS classification. Future improvement: the trigger table should explicitly list `governance/EXECUTION/` and `governance/aimc/` governance programme documents as triggering CANON_GOVERNANCE (or a new GOVERNANCE_PROGRAMME category) to eliminate the ambiguity. This would remove the need to apply A-003 for a well-understood pattern.

*This suggestion has been appended to the Parking Station.*

---

## Open Items for CS2 / Foreman

None. Post-verdict ceremony obligations recorded in §Post-Verdict Ceremony Obligations above.

---

*End of Session Memory — Session 029 — 2026-03-01*
*Token: IAA-session-029-20260301-PASS*
*Authority: CS2 (Johan Ras / @APGI-cmy)*
1. **CANON_GOVERNANCE overlay OVL-CG-001 scope note**: Add a note to `iaa-category-overlays.md` CANON_GOVERNANCE overlay clarifying that OVL-CG-001 applies only to changes in `governance/canon/` files that ARE tracked in CANON_INVENTORY, not all governance document changes. This will prevent future N/A ambiguity on governance spec PRs.

2. **Builder session memory adoption phase validation**: Consider adding a lightweight check: when reviewing builder session memories, if the IAA Invocation Result section claims PHASE_A_ADVISORY in a PHASE_B_BLOCKING era, surface this as an advisory finding. This is a pattern indicator (incorrect mental model about the adoption phase) that could propagate incorrect behaviour.

3. **AC-12 update recommendation to Foreman**: The Foreman should include an optional but recommended post-merge action: update §12 AC-12 from "PENDING CS2 REVIEW" to confirmed once the document is formally approved and merged. This is a minor documentation hygiene improvement.
