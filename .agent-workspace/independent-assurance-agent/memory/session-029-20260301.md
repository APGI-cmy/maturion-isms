invoking_agent: foreman-v2-agent (session-079)
producing_agent: governance-liaison-isms-agent (session-030)
producing_agent_class: specialist
pr_category: AMBIGUOUS (resolved to mandatory invocation by AMBIGUITY RULE — governance/aimc/ spec is not unambiguously exempt)
overlay_applied: CANON_GOVERNANCE (most applicable for governance document change)
independence_confirmed: YES — I did not produce any artifact under review
```

  - A-004: PASS (bootstrap directive complied)
  - A-005: PASS (no .github/agents/ modifications)

core_invariants:
  CORE-001 to CORE-012: N/A (AGENT_CONTRACT scoped; this is not an AGENT_CONTRACT PR)

  CORE-013: PASS (PREHANDOVER present; IAA invoked in this session)
  CORE-014: PASS (no class exemption claim)
  CORE-015: PASS (builder session memory present; Foreman's pending is correct pre-verdict state)

  OVL-CG-003: PASS (version bump 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 present)

## Post-Verdict Mandatory Conditions

The following conditions MUST be met by the Foreman BEFORE opening the PR:

1. Update PREHANDOVER proof iaa_audit_token: IAA-session-029-20260301-PASS
2. Paste verbatim IAA response in PREHANDOVER ## IAA Agent Response (verbatim) section
3. Write Foreman session memory session-079-waveCL5-amendment-20260301.md with IAA token
4. Commit all pending artifacts:
   - governance/aimc/AIMC_KNOWLEDGE_UPLOAD_CENTRE_SPECIFICATION.md (staged)
   - .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-079-waveCL5-amendment-20260301.md (untracked)
   - .agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/memory/session-030-20260301.md (untracked)
   - .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-079-waveCL5-amendment-20260301.md (to be written)

---

## Advisory Findings (Non-Blocking)

1. **AC-12 internal inconsistency**: §12 Acceptance Criteria item AC-12 reads "PENDING CS2 REVIEW" but the document header says APPROVED and §13 confirms CP-5 COMPLETE. This inconsistency was noted by builder (session-030 suggestion #1). Recommended: update AC-12 to confirm CP-5 complete. Does not block merge — CORE-007 keyword list does not match "PENDING CS2 REVIEW."

2. **Builder session memory adoption phase error**: governance-liaison-isms session-030 states "PHASE_A_ADVISORY — IAA not yet deployed. Proceeding under advisory mode." This is factually incorrect — we are in PHASE_B_BLOCKING. The builder should reference the current adoption phase. This does not trigger A-006 (A-006 checks PREHANDOVER `iaa_audit_token` field, not builder session narrative). Non-blocking for this verdict.

---

## Learning Notes

1. **AMBIGUOUS category confirmation**: `governance/aimc/` governance specs that are NOT in `governance/canon/` and NOT agent contracts correctly fall under the AMBIGUOUS category (not CANON_GOVERNANCE strictly, not EXEMPT). The AMBIGUITY RULE correctly triggers mandatory IAA invocation for these artifacts. Foreman's decision to invoke IAA was correct.

2. **Builder adoption-phase misstatement pattern**: governance-liaison-isms session-030 claimed PHASE_A_ADVISORY in a PHASE_B_BLOCKING era. This is the second time a builder/specialist agent has stated an incorrect adoption phase in session memory (see also session-027 learning on trigger table misapplication by governance-liaison-isms). Consider adding FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule: builder session memory claiming PHASE_A_ADVISORY when PHASE_B is active should be flagged as a non-blocking finding, surfaced in IAA verdict, and recommended for correction. This prevents stale advisory-mode thinking from propagating.

3. **CANON_INVENTORY scope clarification**: CANON_INVENTORY tracks only `governance/canon/` files, not all governance artifacts. OVL-CG-001 (CANON_INVENTORY updated) is N/A for governance specs in `governance/aimc/`, `governance/aimc/`, etc. This scope boundary should be noted in the CANON_GOVERNANCE overlay description to prevent future ambiguity.

4. **SHA256 integrity check value**: Builder correctly recorded the spec SHA256 in session memory. IAA independently verified it. This is a good practice that should be encouraged for all governance spec waves.

5. **Pre-commit invocation pattern is correct**: Foreman used `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` in the PREHANDOVER and invoked IAA before committing. This is the correct A-006/A-014 compliant pattern. Verified clean for INC-IAA-SKIP-001.

---

## Fail-Only-Once Updates

No new rules added this session. Builder adoption-phase misstatement pattern noted above. If this pattern recurs in session-030 or subsequent sessions, a new rule should be added: "Builder session memory must not claim an incorrect adoption phase (PHASE_A_ADVISORY when PHASE_B_BLOCKING is active)."

```yaml
fail_only_once_updates: none_this_session
recurring_pattern_check: none_triggering_new_rule (pattern noted for monitoring)
```

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **CANON_GOVERNANCE overlay OVL-CG-001 scope note**: Add a note to `iaa-category-overlays.md` CANON_GOVERNANCE overlay clarifying that OVL-CG-001 applies only to changes in `governance/canon/` files that ARE tracked in CANON_INVENTORY, not all governance document changes. This will prevent future N/A ambiguity on governance spec PRs.

2. **Builder session memory adoption phase validation**: Consider adding a lightweight check: when reviewing builder session memories, if the IAA Invocation Result section claims PHASE_A_ADVISORY in a PHASE_B_BLOCKING era, surface this as an advisory finding. This is a pattern indicator (incorrect mental model about the adoption phase) that could propagate incorrect behaviour.

3. **AC-12 update recommendation to Foreman**: The Foreman should include an optional but recommended post-merge action: update §12 AC-12 from "PENDING CS2 REVIEW" to confirmed once the document is formally approved and merged. This is a minor documentation hygiene improvement.
