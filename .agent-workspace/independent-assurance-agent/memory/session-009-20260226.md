# IAA Session Memory — Session 009 — 2026-02-26

## Session Identity
- session_id: session-009-20260226
- date: 2026-02-26
- agent_version: 6.2.0
- contract_version: 2.0.0

## Invocation Context
- pr_reviewed: PR #623 — Wave 8 Governance Fix: Deployment Gate Enforcement (copilot/fix-wave-8-deployment-gate)
- invoking_agent: foreman-v2-agent v6.2.0 (session-060-20260226)
- producing_agent: governance-liaison-isms-agent (template update); foreman-v2-agent (Phase 4 governance artifacts)
- producing_agent_class: specialist (governance-liaison); orchestrator (foreman)

## Classification
- pr_category: CANON_GOVERNANCE (governance template change; A-003 ambiguity rule applied — governance/templates/ is substantive)
- ambiguity_rule_applied: YES — governance/templates/ is not explicitly listed in trigger table; FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-003 resolves to mandatory invocation
- foreman_builder_mandate_applied: NO — no .github/agents/ files in this PR

## Checks Executed
- checks_executed: 22
- fail_only_once_checks: 2
- core_invariants_checks: 6
- category_overlay_and_requested_checks: 14

## Results
- checks_passed: 22
- checks_failed: 0
- advisory_findings: 1 (non-blocking — PR in DRAFT with primary deliverable staged not committed; governance artifacts untracked; correct pre-merge IAA pattern)
- merge_gate_parity_result: PASS

## Verdict
- verdict: ASSURANCE-TOKEN
- token_reference: IAA-WAVE8-GOVFIX-20260226-PASS
- adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict: PHASE_A_ADVISORY

## Failures Cited
- failures: none

## Advisory Findings (non-blocking)
- advisory_001: PR #623 is currently in DRAFT state. governance/templates/PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md is staged but not committed. Foreman governance artifacts (.agent-admin/prehandover/proof-wave8-deployment-gate-fix-20260226.md, .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-060-20260226.md) and liaison artifacts (.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/memory/session-021-20260226.md, parking-station updates) are untracked. PR body checklist shows Phase 3/4 items unchecked. This is the correct pre-merge IAA invocation pattern (established in sessions 007–008). All artifacts must be committed and PR taken out of DRAFT before CS2 merges. This is not a blocking finding.

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied
- fail_only_once_rules_applied:
    - rule_id: A-001
      outcome: PASS
      notes: PREHANDOVER proof contains iaa_audit_token PENDING slot — IAA correctly withheld merge pending this audit. Evidence of IAA invocation confirmed.
    - rule_id: A-002
      outcome: PASS (N/A — no agent contract files)
      notes: Foreman correctly submitted work for IAA audit; no exemption claim made.
    - rule_id: A-003
      outcome: TRIGGERED — MANDATORY INVOCATION APPLIED
      notes: governance/templates/ is not explicitly listed in trigger table; ambiguity resolves to mandatory invocation. IAA was correctly requested.
    - rule_id: A-004
      outcome: PASS
      notes: IAA agent contract file was the first file read in this session per BOOTSTRAP DIRECTIVE.

## Detailed Findings

### CHECK-1: Phase 1 PREFLIGHT completion — PASS
session-060-20260226.md contains `phase_1_preflight: COMPLETE` and non-empty `preflight_evidence`
field: "All 7 steps executed. Identity declared from YAML. Tier 2 loaded (v1.4.0). CANON_INVENTORY
hash check PASS (0 placeholder hashes). Session memory 055–059 reviewed. FAIL-ONLY-ONCE v1.7.0
attested. Merge gate requirements loaded (7 checks). Status: STANDBY → wave-start authorized by CS2."

### CHECK-2: CS2 Authorization — PASS
gh issue view 622 confirmed author: APGI-cmy. Assignees: Copilot, APGI-cmy. "Copilot" is the
execution vehicle for foreman-v2-agent (copilot-swe-agent per PR #623 author). Issue #622 is a
valid CS2 triggering issue per Foreman contract Phase 2 Step 2.1.

### CHECK-3: No POLC Violation — PASS
All deliverables are governance/documentation paths. Template update delegated to governance-liaison-
isms-agent. Foreman authored only Phase 4 governance artifacts (explicitly permitted by contract).
Git status confirmed: governance/templates/PREHANDOVER_PROOF_TEMPLATE.md staged; governance
artifacts untracked; zero production code (no modules/, apps/, packages/, api/ changes).

### CHECK-4: QP Evaluation — PASS
roles_invoked includes Quality-Professor. Mode transition: POLC-Orchestration → Quality-Professor
(delivery received) → HANDOVER (QP PASS — Gate 6 at line 145 + item 12 at line 305). PREHANDOVER
proof contains full QP evaluation block with QP VERDICT: PASS.

### CHECK-5: Delegation Documented — PASS
agents_delegated_to lists governance-liaison-isms-agent with explicit task and
outcome: "DELIVERED — Gate 6 at line 145, item 12 at line 305. QP PASS."

### CHECK-6: Template Gate 6 Substantively Correct — PASS (IAA independently verified)
Line 145: ### Gate 6: Deployment Gate Confirmation (MANDATORY — Issue #622) ✅
BLOCKING RULE for Issue #622: present ✅
Three-state checklist:
  - Line 158: NOT TRIGGERED ✅
  - Line 159: TRIGGERED AND PASSED ✅
  - Line 160: TRIGGERED AND FAILED — DO NOT MERGE ✅
N/A justification field: present (lines 163-172) ✅
Item 12 at line 305: "Deployment gate confirmed (PASS or N/A with documented justification) —
  Issue #622 mandatory check" ✅

### CHECK-7: FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Attested — PASS
session-060 contains: fail_only_once_attested: true, fail_only_once_version: 1.7.0,
unresolved_breaches: none.

### CHECK-8: OPOJD N/A Gates Correct — PASS
Gate 2 (YAML Syntax): N/A — no YAML files changed ✅

Gate 4 (Tests): N/A — governance-only wave ✅
Gate 6: N/A with documented justification (no deployment-triggering files changed) ✅
Gates 1 and 5: PASS ✅

### CHECK-9: Merge Gate Parity — PASS
All 7 checks listed in session memory with PASS. My 3 required CI checks (from YAML) are all
present in the 7 (Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict, governance/alignment,
stop-and-fix/enforcement). merge_gate_parity: PASS.

### CHECK-10: Parking Station Updated — PASS
suggestions-log.md line 81: new entry for session-060 present, correctly formatted per protocol.

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Updates
- fail_only_once_updates: none required — all existing rules confirmed effective. No new blocking
  pattern identified. Advisory finding (pre-commit artifact state at IAA invocation) is a known
  and accepted pattern per sessions 007 and 008 (session-008 Advisory-001). No new rule warranted.

## Learning Notes
1. **governance/templates/ trigger classification gap**: The trigger table does not explicitly
   mention `governance/templates/` as a CANON_GOVERNANCE trigger. The table says "Any
   governance/canon/ file created or modified." governance/templates/ is a different path.
   In this session, A-003 (ambiguity → mandatory invocation) was correctly applied. Consider
   whether the trigger table should be updated to explicitly include governance/templates/ as
   a triggering path when populated during Phase B activation.

2. **PENDING slot protocol fully mature**: This is the third consecutive session (007, 008, 009)
   where Foreman has used the iaa_audit_token: PENDING slot correctly. The pattern is now
   established and reliable. Recommend formalising this as a named "IAA Token Reservation
   Pattern" in Foreman's contract (as suggested in session-007 learning #2) — it is still
   only implicit.

3. **Governance-only wave structure is clean**: This wave had the clearest audit trail of any
   IAA session to date. PREHANDOVER proof, session memory, delegation record, QP verdict, and
   parking station entry are all complete and independently verifiable. The governance-only
   wave pattern (no build/test gates, N/A documented with justification) is well-understood
   and well-executed.

4. **PR body checklist not updated on draft completion**: The PR was created with a forward-
   looking checklist. By the time IAA was invoked, Phases 3 and 4 were complete (artifacts
   exist) but the PR body still showed them unchecked. This is a cosmetic issue but reinforces
   the advisory finding from session-008 about committing artifacts before IAA invocation.
   Recommend Foreman update the PR body checklist before removing DRAFT status.

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)
**Primary improvement**: The trigger table (iaa-trigger-table.md) should explicitly list
`governance/templates/` as a triggering path under CANON_GOVERNANCE or as its own category
(GOVERNANCE_TEMPLATE). Currently, governance/templates/ is only covered by the A-003 ambiguity
fallback. When the trigger table is fully populated for Phase B, adding governance/templates/
explicitly would remove ambiguity and ensure consistent classification without relying on A-003.

**Secondary improvement**: The PR body checklist pattern (created at wave-start with forward-
looking items) results in completed items showing as unchecked at IAA invocation time. Foreman
should update the PR body checklist to reflect actual completion status before calling IAA.
This would make the PR body a more reliable audit signal and would allow IAA to use it as a
cross-check against the PREHANDOVER proof.

*No degradation observed. Continuous improvement note: Three consecutive clean pre-merge
IAA invocations (007, 008, 009) demonstrate that the PENDING-token protocol is working.
The next governance improvement should focus on making the trigger table unambiguous for
non-canon governance paths (governance/templates/, .agent-admin/, governance/checklists/).*
