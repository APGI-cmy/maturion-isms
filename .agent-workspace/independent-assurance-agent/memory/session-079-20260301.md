## Session-029 REJECTION-PACKAGE Failure Resolution

| Session-029 Failure | Fix Applied | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| CORE-013: No PREHANDOVER proof | PREHANDOVER proof created and committed in `04f06c2` | ✅ RESOLVED |
| CORE-015: No session memory reference | PREHANDOVER proof references session memory; governance-liaison session-030 committed | ✅ RESOLVED |
| CORE-016: No IAA Agent Response section | Section `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` present with PENDING placeholder; token correctly set to PENDING | ✅ RESOLVED (post-token ceremony required) |

---

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

| Rule | Applied | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| A-001 (IAA invocation evidence must be present) | YES | PASS — PREHANDOVER proof with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` present on branch |
| A-002 (no class exceptions) | YES | PASS — no exemption claimed |
| A-006 (PHASE_A_ADVISORY FABRICATION detection) | YES | PASS — token is PENDING, NOT a bare date string. INC-IAA-SKIP-001 NOT triggered |
| A-015 (PREHANDOVER required for triggered PRs) | YES | PASS — PREHANDOVER proof NOW present (was the session-029 failure) |
| A-016 (cross-PR token reuse) | YES | PASS — no real session token cited (PENDING status) |
| A-017 (REJECTION-as-PASS citation) | YES | PASS — no PASS token cited anywhere |

---

## Merge Gate Parity Check (§4.3)

| Check | Local Result |
|---|---|
| Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict | PASS — ASSURANCE-TOKEN issued; all checks GREEN |
| Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment | PASS — PREHANDOVER ceremony complete; no governance violations |
| Merge Gate Interface / stop-and-fix/enforcement | PASS — STOP-AND-FIX not triggered; zero failures |

Parity result: PASS — all 3 checks pass locally.

## Verdict

- verdict: ASSURANCE-TOKEN
- token_reference: IAA-session-079-20260301-PASS
- merge_gate_parity_result: PASS
- adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict: PHASE_B_BLOCKING

## Post-Token Ceremony Obligations

Foreman MUST complete before PR opens:
1. Paste verbatim IAA response into `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section of PREHANDOVER proof
2. Update `iaa_audit_token` from PENDING to `IAA-session-079-20260301-PASS`
3. Commit updated PREHANDOVER proof to branch
4. (Advisory) Create and commit `session-079-wave-CL1-20260301.md` foreman session memory

---

## Prior Sessions: Open REJECTION-PACKAGE Tracking

- session-029 REJECTION-PACKAGE for Wave CL-1 → CLOSED — resolved by this ASSURANCE-TOKEN (session-079)

---

## Fail-Only-Once Updates

NO NEW RULES added this session. All observed patterns already covered by existing rules A-001 through A-017.

---

## Learning Notes

**L-001**: The PENDING → ASSURANCE-TOKEN ceremony pattern works correctly. Foreman created PREHANDOVER proof with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` and `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section present but empty. IAA inspects this state as the correct pre-IAA condition, issues token, then Foreman completes the ceremony by populating the section verbatim and updating the token. This is the canonical two-phase commit for CORE-016.

**L-002**: All three Wave CL-1 deliverable failures from the original PR review (maturion-isms#717 Copilot review flagging `capability: maturity_assessment`) have been completely resolved. The CL-1 fix is sound: `capability: analysis` per AIMC_PERSONA_LIFECYCLE.md §5.1 schema.

**L-003**: Re-audit pattern (session-N → REJECTION-PACKAGE → session-N+K re-invocation → ASSURANCE-TOKEN) functions correctly when all session-N failures are addressed before re-invocation. The re-audit produced ASSURANCE-TOKEN in a single pass because all three ceremony failures were fixed.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

**S-001**: The PENDING → verbatim paste → token update ceremony is now well-established. Consider formalising it as a named ceremony step in the Foreman contract's FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry (e.g., "Post-IAA-Token Ceremony — Step PCN-001") so the ordering is explicit and cannot be confused with other handover steps.

**S-002**: The foreman session-079 memory was still pending at the time of IAA audit. Advisory: Foreman should automate session memory creation as part of Phase 3 OPOJD gate (before invoking IAA) so the file exists in the bundle at audit time, not after.

## Parking Station

Entry to be appended to `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md`:
`| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-079 | Phase 4 | S-001: Formalise PENDING→verbatim paste→token update as named Post-IAA-Token Ceremony (PCN-001) in Foreman FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry | session-079-20260301.md |`
`| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-079 | Phase 4 | S-002: Foreman should create session memory in Phase 3 OPOJD gate (before IAA invocation) so file is in bundle at audit time | session-079-20260301.md |`
