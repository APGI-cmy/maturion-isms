## Verdict

**verdict**: ASSURANCE-TOKEN
**token_reference**: IAA-WAVE5-20260225-PASS
**adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict**: PHASE_A_ADVISORY

## Advisory Findings (non-blocking)

| ID | Finding | Severity |
|----|---------|---------|
| A-F-1 | api-builder PREHANDOVER proof documents wrong model name (`ada-002` vs actual `text-embedding-3-small`) and relative vs absolute endpoint URL. SHA256 matches; code is correct; documentation is inaccurate. | MINOR — advisory |
| A-F-2 | Commit `8503f6e` bundles qa-builder test files with Foreman governance update under `governance:` commit message label. Obscures audit trail. Future sessions should use separate commits for builder deliverables vs governance updates. | MINOR — advisory |

## Prior Sessions Reviewed

**prior_sessions_reviewed**: none — first IAA session

---

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

**fail_only_once_rules_applied**:

| Rule | Applied | Outcome |
|------|---------|---------|
| A-001: IAA invocation evidence must be present | YES | PASS — Foreman PREHANDOVER proof references IAA invocation at Step 4.3a |
| A-002: IAA mandatory for ALL agent contract classes | YES | PASS — Foreman correctly invoked IAA; no exemption claimed |
| A-003: Ambiguity resolves to mandatory invocation | N/A — category unambiguous (AAWP_MAT) | N/A |

---

## fail_only_once_updates

No new rules added this session. The existing registry (A-001, A-002, A-003) covered all observed patterns. The advisory findings (A-F-1, A-F-2) are below the threshold for new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE entries — they are hygiene observations, not governance failure patterns. If either recurs in a subsequent session, elevation to a FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule will be warranted.

---

## Learning Notes

1. **Evidence documentation must exactly match implementation.** The api-builder PREHANDOVER proof documented `text-embedding-ada-002` but the implementation uses `text-embedding-3-small`. In future invocations, IAA should verify that constant values in evidence documentation match actual file content, not just SHA hashes. SHA match confirms file identity; evidence prose must also be accurate.

2. **Multi-agent single-bot commit bundling is an inherent limitation.** When all agents run as the same `copilot-swe-agent[bot]`, Git commit authorship cannot distinguish which agent session made which commit. POLC boundary verification must rely on agent session memory, evidence artifacts, and working-tree state analysis rather than Git author fields. This is a systemic constraint of the environment.

3. **Governance breach detection and correction chain worked as intended.** GOV-BREACH-AIMC-W5-001 (initial POLC violation) was detected by CS2 and corrected. GOV-BREACH-AIMC-W5-002 (preflight skipped again) was caught mid-session and corrected. The Wave 5 re-execution delivered fully compliant work. The governance learning chain (FAIL-ONLY-ONCE → A-009 → A-010 → A-011) is functioning as designed.

4. **First IAA session establishes baseline.** This is session 001. All subsequent IAA sessions should load this session memory to check for any open advisory findings (A-F-1, A-F-2) and assess whether they have recurred. If A-F-1 (evidence documentation inaccuracy) recurs → elevate to FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule. If A-F-2 (commit bundling) recurs → escalate to CS2 for commit discipline guidance.

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Evidence documentation accuracy check (specific, actionable):** Add an explicit IAA check that verifies string constants documented in PREHANDOVER proofs (model names, endpoint URLs, version strings) match the actual file content — not just SHA hash. A SHA match confirms file identity but does not catch documentation prose errors. This would have caught A-F-1 in this session. Suggested new core invariant check: *"For each implementation constant documented in the PREHANDOVER proof, verify the value matches the actual file."*

2. **Commit attribution via agent footprints (specific, actionable):** Foreman and builder agents should include a comment or structured marker in each commit message identifying the authoring agent (e.g., `[qa-builder]`, `[schema-builder]`, `[api-builder]`, `[foreman-v2]`). This would make POLC boundary verification via git history tractable in the single-bot environment without relying solely on agent memory artifacts.
