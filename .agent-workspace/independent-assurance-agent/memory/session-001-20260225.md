## Advisory Findings (non-blocking)

| ID | Finding | Severity |
|----|---------|---------|
| A-F-1 | api-builder PREHANDOVER proof documents wrong model name (`ada-002` vs actual `text-embedding-3-small`) and relative vs absolute endpoint URL. SHA256 matches; code is correct; documentation is inaccurate. | MINOR — advisory |
| A-F-2 | Commit `8503f6e` bundles qa-builder test files with Foreman governance update under `governance:` commit message label. Obscures audit trail. Future sessions should use separate commits for builder deliverables vs governance updates. | MINOR — advisory |

---

## Prior Sessions Reviewed

**prior_sessions_reviewed**: none — first IAA session

---

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

**fail_only_once_rules_applied**:

| Rule | Applied | Outcome |
|------|---------|---------|
| A-001: IAA invocation evidence must be present | YES | PASS — Foreman PREHANDOVER proof references IAA invocation at Step 4.3a |
| A-002: IAA mandatory for ALL agent contract classes | YES | PASS — Foreman correctly invoked IAA; no exemption claimed |
| A-003: Ambiguity resolves to mandatory invocation | N/A — category unambiguous (AAWP_MAT) | N/A |

---

## fail_only_once_updates

No new rules added this session. The existing registry (A-001, A-002, A-003) covered all observed patterns. The advisory findings (A-F-1, A-F-2) are below the threshold for new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE entries — they are hygiene observations, not governance failure patterns. If either recurs in a subsequent session, elevation to a FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule will be warranted.
# IAA Session Memory — Session 001 — 2026-02-25

## Session Identity
- session_id: session-001
- date: 2026-02-25
- agent_version: 6.2.0
- contract_version: 2.0.0

## Invocation Context
- pr_reviewed: N/A — on-demand HEAD audit (current HEAD of main, not a PR). Issue: "IAA assurance request: Complete audit of all builder agent contract files in .github/agents/"
- invoking_agent: copilot (GitHub Copilot Coding Agent acting under IAA protocol per issue instructions)
- producing_agent: CodexAdvisor-agent (builder contracts authored via CS2-approved layer-down)
- producing_agent_class: builder (contracts under audit are builder class: api-builder, schema-builder, ui-builder, qa-builder, integration-builder)

## Classification
- pr_category: AGENT_CONTRACT
- ambiguity_rule_applied: NO — category unambiguous; five builder agent contract files are the stated scope
- foreman_builder_mandate_applied: YES — builder class contracts; IAA invocation mandatory per AGCFPP-001 and FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-002

## Scope
Files audited (current HEAD of main):
- `.github/agents/api-builder.md` (contract_version: 4.0.0, body version: 4.1.0, 23,938 chars)
- `.github/agents/schema-builder.md` (contract_version: 4.0.0, body version: 4.1.0, 26,507 chars)

## Checks Executed
- checks_executed: 25 (15 core + 8 overlay + 2 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE; CORE-013, CORE-015, OVL-AC-006, OVL-AC-007 marked N/A with justification as HEAD audit has no PR bundle)
- fail_only_once_checks: 3 (A-001 N/A — no PR bundle; A-002 PASS; A-003 PASS)
- core_invariants_checks: 15
- category_overlay_checks: 10

---

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Learning Applied

**A-001 (IAA invocation evidence in PR artifacts)**:
Evidence: N/A — this is an on-demand HEAD audit, not a PR review. No PR bundle exists to check.
Outcome: N/A — justified exemption; cannot apply a PR-bundle check to a HEAD audit.

**A-002 (No class exception — builder class mandatory)**:
Evidence: All five contracts explicitly declare `NO-CLASS-EXEMPTION` in their prohibitions YAML and reiterate in Phase 4.6. No class exemption claim found.
Outcome: PASS ✅

**A-003 (Ambiguity resolves to mandatory invocation)**:
Evidence: Category is unambiguous (AGENT_CONTRACT). No ambiguity present.
Outcome: PASS ✅

---

## Core Invariants Results

**CORE-001: YAML frontmatter valid**
Evidence: All five files parse cleanly. YAML delimiter pairs present and balanced. No syntax errors detected.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**CORE-002: Agent version correct**
Evidence: All five have `agent.version: 6.2.0` — matches Living Agent System version.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**CORE-003: Contract version present**
Evidence: All five have `agent.contract_version: 4.0.0` — non-zero, present.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**CORE-004: Identity block complete (identity.role, mission, class_boundary)**
Evidence: YAML identity block (extracted, delimited) for all five contains only:
`no_class_exceptions`, `stop_and_fix_mandate`, `ambiguity_rule`, `lock_id`.
Fields `identity.role`, `identity.mission`, `identity.class_boundary` are absent from all five YAML frontmatters.
Reference: CodexAdvisor-agent.md (canonical reference) has all three fields under `identity:`.
Verdict: FAIL ❌ (all five)
Finding: identity.role, identity.mission, and identity.class_boundary are absent from the YAML frontmatter identity block for api-builder, schema-builder, ui-builder, qa-builder, and integration-builder.
Fix required: Add identity.role (e.g. "API Builder (specialized)"), identity.mission (concise mission statement), and identity.class_boundary (scope boundary statement) to the identity: YAML block in each contract, matching the CodexAdvisor-agent.md pattern. CS2-authorized PR required per AGCFPP-001.

**CORE-005: Governance block present (protocol, version, canon_inventory)**
Evidence: All five have `governance.protocol: LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM` and `governance.canon_inventory: governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json`. Field `governance.version` is absent from all five governance blocks. CodexAdvisor-agent.md has `governance.version: v6.2.0`.
Verdict: FAIL ❌ (all five)
Finding: governance.version is missing from the governance YAML block in all five builder contracts.
Fix required: Add `version: v6.2.0` under the `governance:` key in each contract. CS2-authorized PR required.

**CORE-006: CANON_INVENTORY alignment**
Evidence: All five list expected_artifacts: [governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json, BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md, governance/ROLE_APPOINTMENT_PROTOCOL.md]. CANON_INVENTORY.json (183 entries, zero null/empty hashes — hash integrity PASS) does not contain entries for BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md or governance/ROLE_APPOINTMENT_PROTOCOL.md. These files originate in the canonical governance repo (maturion-foreman-governance) and are not tracked as local canon entries.
Note: This is a consumer-repo pattern — builders reference upstream governance files that are tracked in the foreman-governance repo's CANON_INVENTORY, not the local one. This is an expected consumer pattern, not necessarily a failure.
Verdict: OBSERVATION — not a hard FAIL. The local CANON_INVENTORY.json hash integrity is clean (zero null/empty hashes). Cross-repo expected_artifacts tracking gap is noted for future governance clarification.

**CORE-007: No placeholder content**
Evidence:
- api-builder.md: 1 END marker, no duplicates, no stubs or TODO. PASS ✅
- schema-builder.md: 2 END markers. `*END OF SCHEMA BUILDER FOUR-PHASE CANONICAL CONTRACT*` appears **twice** at the end of the file (content duplication artifact).
- ui-builder.md: 1 END marker. PASS ✅
- qa-builder.md: 1 END marker. PASS ✅
- integration-builder.md: 1 END marker. PASS ✅
Verdict: FAIL ❌ (schema-builder only)
Finding: schema-builder.md has a duplicate terminal line `*END OF SCHEMA BUILDER FOUR-PHASE CANONICAL CONTRACT*` — this is a content artifact from a prior copy/paste or merge operation.
Fix required: Remove the duplicate END-OF-CONTRACT line from schema-builder.md. CS2-authorized PR required.

**CORE-008: Prohibitions block present (id, rule, enforcement fields)**
Evidence: All five have `prohibitions:` as a plain string array. No prohibition entry has structured sub-fields `id:`, `rule:`, or `enforcement:`. Example from api-builder: `- "NO-CLASS-EXEMPTION: I NEVER claim this builder is exempt from IAA oversight."` — this is a plain string, not a structured object.
Note: The core invariants checklist is marked STUB status (must be fully populated from INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md before Phase B). The CodexAdvisor contract also uses a different prohibitions format. This check may be IAA-contract-specific in its current stub form.
Verdict: FAIL ❌ (all five) — advisory given STUB checklist status
Finding: Prohibitions are plain string arrays without structured id/rule/enforcement sub-fields in all five builder contracts.
Fix required (advisory): Consider restructuring at least one prohibition per contract to have explicit id, rule, and enforcement sub-fields once the canonical prohibition schema is defined in INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md. CS2 guidance needed before Phase B enforcement.

**CORE-009: Merge gate interface present**
Evidence: All five have `merge_gate_interface.required_checks` with three checks:
- "Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict"
- "Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment"
- "Merge Gate Interface / stop-and-fix/enforcement"
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**CORE-010: Tier 2 knowledge indexed**
Evidence:
- YAML: None of the five contracts have a `tier2_knowledge` block in their YAML frontmatter.
- Workspace: `.agent-workspace/<agent>/knowledge/index.md` is ABSENT for all five:
  - api-builder: ABSENT
  - schema-builder: ABSENT
  - ui-builder: ABSENT
  - qa-builder: ABSENT
  - integration-builder: ABSENT
  Exception: ui-builder has `.agent-workspace/ui-builder/knowledge/wave-component-specs.md` but no index.md.
Verdict: FAIL ❌ (all five)
Finding: No tier2_knowledge YAML block and no Tier 2 knowledge index.md stub in .agent-workspace for any of the five builder contracts.
Fix required: (1) Create `.agent-workspace/<agent>/knowledge/index.md` stub for each builder. (2) Add `tier2_knowledge.index` field to YAML frontmatter referencing the stub path. CS2-authorized PR required for YAML change; workspace file creation is non-protected.

**CORE-011: Four-phase structure present**
Evidence: All five contracts have Phase 1 (Preflight), Phase 2 (Induction Script), Phase 3 (Build Script), and Phase 4 (Handover Script) fully present with section headings and content.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**CORE-012: Self-modification lock present**
Evidence: All five have a `🔒 LOCKED: Self-Modification Prohibition` section with CRITICAL CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT language. However, a Lock ID mismatch exists between YAML and body for all five:
- api-builder: YAML `identity.lock_id: SELF-MOD-API-001` | Body `**Lock ID**: SELF-MOD-001` — MISMATCH
- schema-builder: YAML `identity.lock_id: SELF-MOD-SCHEMA-001` | Body `**Lock ID**: SELF-MOD-001` — MISMATCH
- ui-builder: YAML `identity.lock_id: SELF-MOD-UI-001` | Body `**Lock ID**: SELF-MOD-001` — MISMATCH
- qa-builder: YAML `identity.lock_id: SELF-MOD-QA-001` | Body `**Lock ID**: SELF-MOD-001` — MISMATCH
- integration-builder: YAML `identity.lock_id: SELF-MOD-INT-001` | Body `**Lock ID**: SELF-MOD-002` — MISMATCH (also the only one that differs between agents in the body — body says SELF-MOD-002, not SELF-MOD-001)
The self-modification prohibition itself is constitutionally declared and enforceable. The Lock ID inconsistency is a traceability defect.
Verdict: FAIL ❌ (all five) — prohibition present but Lock ID reference is inconsistent
Finding: Lock ID in YAML identity.lock_id does not match Lock ID reference in the LOCKED section body for all five contracts. integration-builder has a uniquely erroneous body reference (SELF-MOD-002 instead of SELF-MOD-001 or SELF-MOD-INT-001).
Fix required: Update body `**Lock ID**:` references to match their respective YAML `identity.lock_id` values. CS2-authorized PR required.

**CORE-013: IAA invocation evidence**
Evidence: N/A — this is an on-demand HEAD audit with no associated PR. No PR bundle exists to inspect for IAA invocation evidence.
Verdict: N/A — justified. Cannot apply PR-bundle check to HEAD audit.

**CORE-014: No class exemption claim**
Evidence: All five explicitly prohibit class exemption claims:
- YAML prohibitions include: `"NO-CLASS-EXEMPTION: I NEVER claim this builder is exempt from IAA oversight. Any such claim is a governance violation."`
- Phase 4.6 of all five: "No Class Exemptions — This builder class is NOT exempt from IAA oversight"
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**CORE-015: Session memory present**
Evidence: N/A — this is a HEAD audit; no PR bundle to inspect for session memory artifacts.
Verdict: N/A — justified.

---

## Category Overlay Results (AGENT_CONTRACT)

**OVL-AC-001: AGCFPP-001 policy reference (canonical path+name)**
Evidence: All five have:
```yaml
policy_refs:
  - id: AGCFPP-001
    name: Agent Contract File Protection Policy
    path: governance/canon/AGENT_CONTRACT_FILE_PROTECTION_POLICY.md
    role: iaa-invocation-mandate
```
Name matches canonical: "Agent Contract File Protection Policy" ✅
Path matches canonical: `governance/canon/AGENT_CONTRACT_FILE_PROTECTION_POLICY.md` ✅
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**OVL-AC-002: IAA oversight block**
Evidence: None of the five have an explicit `iaa_oversight:` YAML block. However, all five have `policy_refs` confirming IAA authority via AGCFPP-001 (role: iaa-invocation-mandate). The overlay check accepts either form.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five — via policy_refs path)

**OVL-AC-003: Four-phase canonical structure**
Evidence: All four phases fully present in all five contracts, with mandatory evidence output declarations (PREHANDOVER proof checklist in Phase 4.1, session memory in Phase 4.2, gate parity in Phase 4.3, IAA invocation in Phase 4.6).
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**OVL-AC-004: Self-modification prohibition CONSTITUTIONAL enforcement**
Evidence: All five have `🔒 LOCKED: Self-Modification Prohibition` with explicit "CRITICAL CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT" heading. Constitutional enforcement is present and declared in the contract body.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**OVL-AC-005: No Tier 2 content embedded**
Evidence: No Tier 2 runtime knowledge (session history, personal learnings, patterns) is inlined in any of the five contract bodies. Wave-specific specifications in ui-builder and integration-builder are Phase 3 build instructions, not Tier 2 session state.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**OVL-AC-006: PREHANDOVER proof in bundle**
Evidence: N/A — HEAD audit, no PR bundle.
Verdict: N/A — justified.

**OVL-AC-007: Session memory in bundle**
Evidence: N/A — HEAD audit, no PR bundle.
Verdict: N/A — justified.

**OVL-AC-008: Tier 2 stub present (.agent-workspace/<agent>/knowledge/index.md)**
Evidence: index.md is ABSENT for all five agents in their respective .agent-workspace knowledge directories.
- `.agent-workspace/api-builder/knowledge/index.md` — ABSENT
- `.agent-workspace/schema-builder/knowledge/index.md` — ABSENT
- `.agent-workspace/ui-builder/knowledge/index.md` — ABSENT (wave-component-specs.md present, but no index)
- `.agent-workspace/qa-builder/knowledge/index.md` — ABSENT
- `.agent-workspace/integration-builder/knowledge/index.md` — ABSENT
Verdict: FAIL ❌ (all five)
Finding: Tier 2 knowledge index.md stub is missing for all five builder agents.
Fix required: Create `.agent-workspace/<agent>/knowledge/index.md` stubs for each builder. This does not require a CS2-authorized PR for the workspace files (non-protected path), but the corresponding YAML `tier2_knowledge` block addition does.

**OVL-AC-009: Character count within limit (< 30,000)**
Evidence: All five are within limit:
- api-builder: 23,938 chars ✅
- schema-builder: 26,507 chars ✅
- ui-builder: 28,551 chars ✅
- qa-builder: 27,484 chars ✅
- integration-builder: 27,368 chars ✅
Note: ui-builder (28,551) is closest to the 30,000 limit. Monitoring warranted.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

**OVL-AC-010: No hardcoded version strings**
Evidence: Phase bodies reference governance documents by path and title, not by hardcoded version numbers. The body footer `**Version**: 4.1.0` is a contract body annotation, not a hardcoded version in the phase execution logic. No phase instruction reads identity from hardcoded strings instead of YAML.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (all five)

## Merge Gate Parity Check (§4.3)

HEAD audit — no PR is being opened. Merge gate parity is not directly applicable.
Local equivalent checks run:
- YAML syntax validation: PASS (all five parse cleanly)
- Character count check: PASS (all five < 30,000)
- AGCFPP-001 canonical path+name: PASS (all five)
- CANON_INVENTORY hash integrity: PASS (zero null/empty hashes, 183 entries)
- Four-phase structure: PASS (all five)
Parity result: N/A (HEAD audit, no merge pending) — local equivalents: PASS on format/structural checks, FAIL on governance field completeness.

## Verdict

═══════════════════════════════════════
REJECTION-PACKAGE
Audit scope: 5 builder agent contracts (current HEAD of main)
7 check(s) FAILED. STOP-AND-FIX required.
FAILURES:
  CORE-004: Identity block incomplete — Finding: identity.role, identity.mission, identity.class_boundary absent from YAML in all five contracts — Fix: Add these three fields to identity: block per CodexAdvisor-agent.md pattern. CS2 PR required.
  CORE-005: governance.version missing — Finding: governance.version field absent from all five contract governance blocks — Fix: Add `version: v6.2.0` to governance: YAML block. CS2 PR required.
  CORE-007: Duplicate content — Finding: schema-builder.md has duplicate terminal `*END OF SCHEMA BUILDER FOUR-PHASE CANONICAL CONTRACT*` line — Fix: Remove one duplicate. CS2 PR required.
  CORE-008: Prohibitions not structured — Finding: Prohibitions are plain string arrays without id/rule/enforcement sub-fields in all five — Fix: Align to canonical prohibition schema once defined in INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md. Advisory until Phase B.
  CORE-010: Tier 2 knowledge missing — Finding: No tier2_knowledge YAML block and no index.md stub in .agent-workspace for all five — Fix: Create index.md stubs; add tier2_knowledge.index to YAML. CS2 PR required for YAML.
  CORE-012: Lock ID mismatch — Finding: YAML identity.lock_id and body **Lock ID**: reference are inconsistent in all five; integration-builder body says SELF-MOD-002 (unique error) — Fix: Align body Lock ID references to YAML values per agent. CS2 PR required.
  OVL-AC-008: Tier 2 index.md absent — Finding: .agent-workspace/<agent>/knowledge/index.md missing for all five builders — Fix: Create stub index.md files (non-protected path, no CS2 PR needed for workspace files).
This audit does not block a PR (no PR is open). All findings are recorded for CS2 review and action.
Adoption phase: PHASE_A_ADVISORY — verdict is informational. Findings must be surfaced to CS2. Blocking enforcement begins Phase B.

## Learning Notes

1. **Evidence documentation must exactly match implementation.** The api-builder PREHANDOVER proof documented `text-embedding-ada-002` but the implementation uses `text-embedding-3-small`. In future invocations, IAA should verify that constant values in evidence documentation match actual file content, not just SHA hashes. SHA match confirms file identity; evidence prose must also be accurate.

2. **Multi-agent single-bot commit bundling is an inherent limitation.** When all agents run as the same `copilot-swe-agent[bot]`, Git commit authorship cannot distinguish which agent session made which commit. POLC boundary verification must rely on agent session memory, evidence artifacts, and working-tree state analysis rather than Git author fields. This is a systemic constraint of the environment.

3. **Governance breach detection and correction chain worked as intended.** GOV-BREACH-AIMC-W5-001 (initial POLC violation) was detected by CS2 and corrected. GOV-BREACH-AIMC-W5-002 (preflight skipped again) was caught mid-session and corrected. The Wave 5 re-execution delivered fully compliant work. The governance learning chain (FAIL-ONLY-ONCE → A-009 → A-010 → A-011) is functioning as designed.

4. **First IAA session establishes baseline.** This is session 001. All subsequent IAA sessions should load this session memory to check for any open advisory findings (A-F-1, A-F-2) and assess whether they have recurred. If A-F-1 (evidence documentation inaccuracy) recurs → elevate to FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule. If A-F-2 (commit bundling) recurs → escalate to CS2 for commit discipline guidance.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Evidence documentation accuracy check (specific, actionable):** Add an explicit IAA check that verifies string constants documented in PREHANDOVER proofs (model names, endpoint URLs, version strings) match the actual file content — not just SHA hash. A SHA match confirms file identity but does not catch documentation prose errors. This would have caught A-F-1 in this session. Suggested new core invariant check: *"For each implementation constant documented in the PREHANDOVER proof, verify the value matches the actual file."*

2. **Commit attribution via agent footprints (specific, actionable):** Foreman and builder agents should include a comment or structured marker in each commit message identifying the authoring agent (e.g., `[qa-builder]`, `[schema-builder]`, `[api-builder]`, `[foreman-v2]`). This would make POLC boundary verification via git history tractable in the single-bot environment without relying solely on agent memory artifacts.

*Authority: CS2 (Johan Ras / @APGI-cmy) | independent-assurance-agent v2.0.0 | 2026-02-25*
- learning_notes: >
    First IAA session in this repository. Key systemic pattern observed across all five builder contracts:
    the YAML identity block diverges from the CodexAdvisor-agent.md canonical pattern — missing
    identity.role, identity.mission, identity.class_boundary. This suggests the builder contract
    template used for the Wave 5/6 four-phase upgrade did not fully adopt the IAA-required identity
    block structure. The Lock ID mismatch (YAML has agent-specific IDs, body retains generic SELF-MOD-001)
    is a copy-paste artifact from the upgrade process where body text was not updated to match the YAML.
    integration-builder's unique body Lock ID of SELF-MOD-002 suggests it was copied from a different
    source contract. Both findings indicate a systematic gap in post-upgrade consistency verification.
    governance.version absent from all five governance blocks — CodexAdvisor-agent.md has this field;
    builder contracts were not aligned to the same governance YAML structure. Tier 2 knowledge stubs
    (index.md) are absent from all five builders — this is a Phase B activation prerequisite that
    has not been completed. Recommend CS2 commission a single remediation PR covering all five contracts
    for consistency fixes, rather than five separate PRs.

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Updates
- fail_only_once_updates: >
    Considered adding A-004: "Builder contract YAML body consistency check — YAML lock_id must match
    body Lock ID reference." Not yet codified as a rule because this is first session observation.
    Recommend CS2 review before adding as permanent rule. Will flag for next session.

## Prior Sessions Reviewed
- prior_sessions_reviewed: none — first session

## Unresolved Items Carried Forward
- unresolved_items:
    - CORE-004/005/010/012: Await CS2-authorized remediation PR for YAML additions/corrections (all five builders)
    - CORE-007: Await CS2-authorized remediation PR for schema-builder duplicate footer removal
    - CORE-008: Await INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md population before Phase B enforcement of structured prohibitions
    - OVL-AC-008: Tier 2 index.md stubs can be created without CS2 PR — flag for CodexAdvisor to action

## Suggestions for Improvement
- suggestions: >
    Concrete improvement: Add a pre-commit or merge-gate YAML consistency check that verifies
    identity.lock_id (YAML) matches the `**Lock ID**:` reference in the LOCKED body section for
    each agent contract. This would have caught the Lock ID mismatch across all five builder contracts
    automatically without requiring manual IAA audit. The check is simple (regex match between YAML
    field and Markdown bold field) and can be implemented as a CI step in .github/workflows/agent-contract-audit.yml.
    Secondary improvement: The four-phase contract upgrade process should include a post-upgrade
    diff against the canonical CodexAdvisor-agent.md YAML structure to catch missing governance fields
    (governance.version, identity.role/mission/class_boundary) before merging.
