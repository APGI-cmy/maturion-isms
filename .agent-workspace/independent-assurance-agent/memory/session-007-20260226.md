## Detailed Findings

### PREHANDOVER Proof (CORE-1): PASS
All required fields present: session_id, date, agent version, wave description, builder list,
QP verdicts (both qa-builder PASS and schema-builder PASS with itemised checkboxes),
OPOJD gate PASS, CANON_INVENTORY confirmed, bundle list (5 artifacts), merge_gate_parity PASS,
CS2 authorization (Issue #593 by @APGI-cmy), mandatory checklist present,
iaa_audit_token PENDING slot correctly reserved for this invocation.

### Session Memory (CORE-2): PASS
All required fields populated per session-memory-template.md. Suggestions for Improvement
non-blank with concrete actionable suggestion (schema-test-template.ts). Parking station entry
appended.

### QP Verdicts Genuine (CORE-3): PASS
Actual test run verified: 94/94 passing, EpisodicMemoryAdapter.test.ts fails at load (expected).
Foreman QP verdicts reflect actual test execution outcomes — no rubber-stamping.

### Schema Tests GREEN (OVERLAY-1): PASS
9 EpisodicMemorySchema tests passed in live test run. No file failure for schema test file.

### Adapter Tests Correct Failure (OVERLAY-2): PASS
Adapter test file fails at module load: "Failed to load url ../../memory/EpisodicMemoryAdapter.js
... Does the file exist?" — exactly the expected Wave 9.3 failure mode. Tests did not fail
individually with weakened assertions — the module simply does not exist yet.

### No Stubs (OVERLAY-3): PASS
Zero instances of expect(true).toBe(true), expect(1).toBe(1), .todo, .skip, xit, xdescribe
found in either test file. Tests use substantive regex assertions against SQL content.

### Migration Columns (OVERLAY-4): PASS
All 10 required columns present: id (UUID PK, gen_random_uuid()), organisation_id (TEXT NOT NULL),
session_id (TEXT nullable), user_id (TEXT nullable), agent_id (TEXT nullable),
event_type (TEXT NOT NULL), capability (TEXT NOT NULL), summary (TEXT nullable),
full_context (TEXT nullable), created_at (TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()).

### Immutability Rules (OVERLAY-5): PASS
ai_episodic_events_no_update (ON UPDATE TO ai_episodic_events DO INSTEAD NOTHING) ✅
ai_episodic_events_no_delete (ON DELETE TO ai_episodic_events DO INSTEAD NOTHING) ✅
Pattern matches ai_telemetry precedent.

### RLS Enabled (OVERLAY-6): PASS
ALTER TABLE ai_episodic_events ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY present.

### INSERT Policy (OVERLAY-7): PASS
ai_episodic_events_insert_org_scope policy present — FOR INSERT WITH CHECK
(organisation_id = current_setting('app.current_organisation_id', true)).

### SELECT Policy (OVERLAY-8): PASS
ai_episodic_events_select_org_scope policy present — FOR SELECT USING
(organisation_id = current_setting('app.current_organisation_id', true)).

### Indexes (OVERLAY-9): PASS
All 4 required indexes present:
- idx_ai_episodic_events_org (organisation_id)
- idx_ai_episodic_events_session (session_id) WHERE session_id IS NOT NULL — partial index correct
- idx_ai_episodic_events_event_type (event_type)
- idx_ai_episodic_events_created_at (created_at)

### Diff Scope (OVERLAY-10): PASS
Exactly 3 files changed vs origin branch — no repo pollution:
1. packages/ai-centre/src/__tests__/memory/EpisodicMemoryAdapter.test.ts
2. packages/ai-centre/src/__tests__/memory/EpisodicMemorySchema.test.ts
3. packages/ai-centre/supabase/migrations/004_ai_episodic_memory.sql

### POLC Compliance (OVERLAY-11): PASS
Session memory records Implementation Guard activation and immediate rejection of
self-implementation. All work delegated to qa-builder (tests) and schema-builder (migration).
separation_violations_detected: none.

### CS2 Authorization (OVERLAY-12): PASS
Issue #593 "[Wave 9.1] AIMC – Schema: Episodic Memory Table (ai_episodic_events)"
opened by APGI-cmy (CS2) confirmed via gh issue list.

## Learning Notes
- learning_notes: >
    Wave 9.1 represents a clean, well-structured AAWP_MAT delivery. The QA-first pattern
    (RED gate → implementation → GREEN) was executed correctly: qa-builder established RED gates
    for both schema and adapter test suites; schema-builder delivered the migration turning 9
    schema tests GREEN while 7 adapter tests remain correctly RED pending Wave 9.3.
    
    The schema SQL verification approach (read migration file as string, assert against regex
    patterns) is an effective and reusable pattern that IAA should expect as the canonical
    approach for all future migration schema verification waves. Tests are substantive — not
    stubs — and provide machine-verifiable contracts for SQL DDL.
    
    Minor discrepancy noted: commit message for RED gate commit said "(6 tests)" for
    EpisodicMemoryAdapter.test.ts but the actual file contains 7 tests. PREHANDOVER correctly
    documents 7 tests. This is a cosmetic commit message error (not a governance failure) —
    actual deliverable is correct. No corrective action required.
    
    A-010 (IAA-INVOKE-001) invocation is operating correctly for AAWP_MAT waves. Foreman
    reserved the iaa_audit_token slot in PREHANDOVER before handover — this is the correct
    protocol and should be reinforced as a standing expectation for all future waves.

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Updates
- fail_only_once_updates: none — all existing rules confirmed effective; no new patterns requiring
  new rule codification observed in this session.

## Suggestions for Improvement

The Wave 9.1 delivery demonstrated that the PREHANDOVER `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` slot
protocol works well as a coordination mechanism. Consider formalising this as a named protocol
in the Foreman contract (e.g., "IAA token reservation pattern") so future waves explicitly
follow it — currently it is implicit in Foreman's Phase 4.3a step but not named.

*No degradation observed. Continuous improvement note: The schema-SQL-regex test pattern
established in Wave 9.1 should be documented as a reusable template in the qa-builder's
Tier 2 knowledge (`schema-test-template.ts`) so future migration waves have a canonical
starting point, reducing setup time and ensuring consistency.*
