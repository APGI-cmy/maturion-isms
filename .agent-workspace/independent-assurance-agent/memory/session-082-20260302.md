## Phase 3 — Content Quality Assessment (informational)

Despite process failures, the content of all four deliverables is of HIGH quality:

- **RCA MAT-RCA-002**: 12 failures (F-01 to F-12) documented with root cause analysis, cascade mapping, and prevention actions. 6 preventive actions (PA-01 to PA-06) map directly to Wave 13 tasks. 4 structural governance improvements (WGI-01 to WGI-04) address systemic gaps.
- **Implementation plan v2.3.0**: PBFAG checks 9-13 correctly added (E2E auth, schema existence, full-flow wiring, major page content, env var audit). Wave 13 §2.14 has 5 tasks, 24 individually-defined test IDs (4 SCH + 4 AUTH + 8 WIRE + 5 E2E + 3 CI = 24), 7 gap register entries, sequential delegation sequence.
- **BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER**: Current stage accurately updated to Wave 13 OPEN. Next step 34 added. Wave 13 section has description, entry criteria, state machine, gap register, and delegation sequence.
- **Session memory**: All required fields present. POLC boundary explicitly confirmed (no code written). Suggestions for improvement non-blank and substantive.

## Adoption Phase Modifier

PHASE_B_BLOCKING — verdicts are hard-blocking. REJECTION-PACKAGE prevents PR from being opened.

---

## Merge Gate Parity (§4.3)

| Check | Local Result |
|-------|-------------|
| Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict | FAIL — 5 checks failed |
| Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment | FAIL — artifact bundle incomplete |
| Merge Gate Interface / stop-and-fix/enforcement | FAIL — CORE-013 STOP-AND-FIX triggered |

**Parity result**: FAIL — all 3 merge gate checks fail locally.

## Verdict

| token_reference | N/A |
| checks_executed | 16 |

## Failures Cited

| # | Check | Finding | Fix Required |
|---|-------|---------|--------------|
| 1 | A-001 + CORE-013 | PREHANDOVER proof absent entirely from branch | Create PREHANDOVER-session-084-wave13-plan-20260302.md with iaa_audit_token: PENDING |
| 2 | CORE-015 | Session memory untracked — not in committed branch state | git add + commit session memory |
| 3 | CORE-016 | No PREHANDOVER proof = no IAA Agent Response (verbatim) section possible | Create PREHANDOVER proof; re-invoke IAA; paste verbatim output |
| 4 | OVL-AM-002 | RCA document untracked; session memory untracked; PREHANDOVER absent; uncommitted mods to 3 files | git add -u + git add untracked files + git commit all in one coherent commit |

**Complete fix sequence**:
1. Create `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-084-wave13-plan-20260302.md` with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`
2. `git add modules/mat/05-rca/RCA_WAVE12_POST_DEPLOYMENT_WIRING_FAILURES_20260302.md`
3. `git add .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-084-wave13-plan-20260302.md`
4. `git add .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-084-wave13-plan-20260302.md`
5. `git add -u` (stage uncommitted mods to implementation-plan.md, BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md, suggestions-log.md)
6. `git commit -m "Wave 13 planning: complete artifact bundle with PREHANDOVER proof"`
7. Re-invoke IAA
8. Paste verbatim IAA output into `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section of PREHANDOVER proof
9. Update `iaa_audit_token` to issued token reference
10. Commit and open PR

## Learning Notes

1. **Content-complete ≠ Process-complete**: Session-084 deliverables are substantively excellent (high-quality RCA, complete Wave 13 plan, well-structured governance artifacts) but the PREHANDOVER ceremony was never initialized. The foreman created all four deliverables AND referenced the PREHANDOVER proof in session memory's cross-references table — but the PREHANDOVER proof itself was never created. This is the most common process failure pattern in AAWP_MAT sessions.

2. **Uncommitted state is invisible to PRs**: Three committed files had post-commit modifications on disk that were never staged. These would be invisible if a PR were opened from the current HEAD. The full work product only exists in the working directory, not in the branch history.

3. **PREHANDOVER proof is the ceremony anchor**: Without the PREHANDOVER proof containing `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`, there is no artifact to update with IAA output. The ceremony cannot complete even if IAA is invoked, because there is nowhere to record the result. The PREHANDOVER proof must be created BEFORE IAA is invoked, not after.

4. **Pattern to watch**: Foreman session memory correctly listed PREHANDOVER proof in cross-references but file was never created. This may indicate a workflow where cross-references are added optimistically. Future FAIL-ONLY-ONCE consideration: PREHANDOVER proof creation should be verified as a Phase 1 action by the foreman, not just listed as a future artifact.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

**Primary suggestion (concrete, actionable)**: Add a FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule (A-018) to the foreman registry specifically for PREHANDOVER proof creation: "The PREHANDOVER proof must be created and committed to the branch BEFORE IAA is invoked. If the PREHANDOVER proof is referenced in session memory's cross-references but does not exist on disk, the ceremony is incomplete. PREHANDOVER proof creation is the FIRST step of wave closure — not a deliverable created alongside the other artifacts." This prevents the pattern where all other artifacts exist but the IAA anchor document is missing.

**Secondary suggestion**: Consider adding a git pre-push hook or CI check that detects sessions where a PREHANDOVER proof is referenced in foreman session memory but the file does not exist in the commit. This would catch the missing-PREHANDOVER pattern before IAA invocation is attempted.

---

## fail_only_once_updates

No new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rules added this session. The pattern observed (PREHANDOVER proof absent while all other artifacts present) is sufficiently addressed by A-001 and CORE-013 + CORE-016. However, the foreman-v2-agent's FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry should receive a corresponding rule that PREHANDOVER proof creation is a first-action prerequisite, not a concurrent deliverable. This is a Foreman-side addition (not IAA-side), flagged as a suggestion to CS2.
