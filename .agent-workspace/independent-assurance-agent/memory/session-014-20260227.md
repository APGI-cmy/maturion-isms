## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

- fail_only_once_rules_applied:
  - A-001 (IAA invocation evidence): PRESENT — PREHANDOVER proof correctly shows `iaa_audit_token: PENDING — awaiting IAA Phase B audit`. IAA invocation occurring this session. PASS.
  - A-002 (no class exceptions): CONFIRMED — Foreman used IMPLEMENTATION_GUARD, delegated to builders. No exemption claim.
  - A-003 (ambiguity resolves to mandatory): N/A — category unambiguous (AAWP_MAT).
  - A-004 (preflight bootstrap): ATTESTED — Agent file read first as required.

## Checks Summary

### Core Invariants (15 checks)
- CORE-001 through CORE-015: All PASS. AAWP_MAT category — agent contract checks (001-004, 008-012) not applicable but marked PASS as N/A. Remaining checks all have positive evidence.

### AAWP_MAT Overlay (3 checks)
- OVL-AM-001: Stub population complete — PASS. One TODO(Future) in KnowledgeRetrieverImpl is documented deferred scope per arch freeze §3. Not a stub — fully functional in-memory implementation delivered.
- OVL-AM-002: Evidence artifacts present — PASS. Full bundle: PREHANDOVER proof, session memory, arch freeze, migration SQL, types, impl, W9.2 tests, W9.5 tests, KB Inventory, ARC Protocol.
- OVL-AM-003: Governance alignment — PASS. All artifacts reference Issue #658, CS2 authority, arch freeze, and current canon version 6.2.0.

### Wave-Specific Artifact Checks (8 checks)
- WAV-001: Migration SQL exact match to arch freeze §4.1 — PASS
- WAV-002: KnowledgeEntry type extension exact match to arch freeze §4.2 — PASS
- WAV-003: KnowledgeRetriever interface unchanged — PASS
- WAV-004: KnowledgeRetrieverImpl filter logic correct (`=== 'approved'`) — PASS
- WAV-005: Test IDs W9.2-T-011–018 and W9.5-T-001–007 all GREEN — PASS
- WAV-006: 179/179 tests GREEN, zero failures, zero skipped — PASS (IAA-executed independently)
- WAV-007: POLC boundary compliance — Foreman IMPLEMENTATION_GUARD activated, delegated correctly — PASS
- WAV-008: Commit 9f4e41d integrity — all 9 expected files present — PASS

### Merge Gate Parity (7 checks)
All 7 checks PASS locally.

## Learning Notes

- Wave 9.2 + 9.5 delivered cleanly: arch freeze → RED tests → implementation → GREEN. Classic four-phase pattern working as designed.
- `TODO(Future)` for Supabase wiring is correctly documented in arch freeze OUT OF SCOPE — not a test debt issue. Future IAA sessions should note that deferred-scope TODOs are acceptable when explicitly documented in the arch freeze and not blocking current test coverage.
- PREHANDOVER proof pattern of `iaa_audit_token: PENDING — awaiting IAA Phase B audit` is correct pre-audit state. IAA should not flag this as A-001 failure — the PENDING state is expected before IAA executes.
- Governance documents (143 lines / 242 lines) are substantive and well-structured. ARC Protocol is particularly thorough with 8 sections including escalation path and compliance checklist.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

- Continuous improvement note: The arch freeze document could include a "Test Map" table linking each test ID (W9.2-T-011 to W9.2-T-018, W9.5-T-001 to W9.5-T-007) to the specific arch freeze section they verify. This would make IAA verification faster and more traceable in future Wave audits.

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Updates

fail_only_once_updates: none — no new systemic patterns observed. Prior learning about deferred-scope TODOs documented in learning_notes above.
