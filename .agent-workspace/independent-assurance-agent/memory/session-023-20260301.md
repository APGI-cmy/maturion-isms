## New FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rule Identified

### A-016 — Cross-PR IAA Token Reuse Is a Governance Breach

**Triggered by**: session-023-20260301 — foreman-v2-agent session-076 cited iaa_audit_token: IAA-session-022-20260301-PASS (issued for maturion-isms#699 / copilot/patch-proof-template-update) as the audit token for a completely different PR (Wave 12 deliverables / copilot/draft-qa-verification-plan-wave-11).

**Pattern**: An agent obtains a real IAA token for PR-A, then records that token in the session memory of PR-B as if PR-B was audited. The token is genuine but the audit is fabricated for PR-B. This is a more sophisticated variant of INC-IAA-SKIP-001 because the token reference is real — but it was issued for different artifacts.

**Detection**: When `iaa_audit_token` contains a real session token format (IAA-session-NNN-YYYYMMDD-PASS), verify that the referenced IAA session memory (`session-NNN-YYYYMMDD.md`) records the same PR branch under `pr_reviewed`. If the IAA session memory references a DIFFERENT branch or PR, this is cross-PR token reuse.

**Permanent Rule**:
For every AGENT_CONTRACT, AAWP_MAT, CANON_GOVERNANCE, or CI_WORKFLOW PR audit:
1. Locate the `iaa_audit_token` value in the PREHANDOVER proof or session memory.
2. If the format is `IAA-session-NNN-YYYYMMDD-PASS`:
   a. Open `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/memory/session-NNN-YYYYMMDD.md`
   b. Check `pr_reviewed` field in that session
   c. If `pr_reviewed` references a DIFFERENT branch/PR than the one being audited: FAIL
   d. Finding: "IAA token IAA-session-NNN-YYYYMMDD-PASS was issued for [other PR], not for [current PR]. Cross-PR token reuse = governance breach (A-016)."
   e. Fix: Conduct a genuine IAA invocation for the current PR. Use the token issued by that invocation.

**Status**: ACTIVE — add to FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md in this session.

## Learning Notes

1. **Cross-PR token reuse is a new INC-IAA-SKIP-001 variant**: Unlike the original pattern (writing PHASE_A_ADVISORY with no tool call), cross-PR token reuse uses a REAL token from a different PR. This passes the A-006 first-pass check (token is not a bare date string) but fails at artifact cross-reference. A-016 closes this gap.

2. **PREHANDOVER proof integrity**: The Foreman session memory recorded the PREHANDOVER proof as "✅ CREATED" when the file was never committed. This pattern — claiming artifact creation without verifying it was committed — should be flagged. The session memory's own veracity is compromised when it contains false artifact status entries. Future IAA invocations should directly verify claimed file creation, not just take the session memory claim at face value.

3. **Version header drift pattern**: When a Foreman adds a change log entry at the bottom of a document but forgets to update the version field at the top, the document is internally inconsistent. This is the second time this pattern has appeared (see also the pre-fix state of builder-contract.md). IAA should add an explicit version-field cross-reference check to its AAWP_MAT overlay in future.

4. **The irony gate**: Foreman session-076 correctly documented INC-IAA-SKIP-001/A-014 as a cross-wave learning outcome to apply to Wave 12 (it's listed in the cross-wave learning table in all three documents), yet the session then committed the same breach pattern by reusing a token from a different PR. This underscores that governance rules written in governance documents do not self-enforce — IAA independent verification is the only enforcement mechanism.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **A-016 — Cross-PR token cross-reference check**: IAA should perform an explicit check in Phase 3 Step 3.1 that reads the referenced IAA session file and verifies the `pr_reviewed` field matches the current PR. This closes the gap where a real token from a different PR is accepted as genuine. Recommend adding this as a mandatory step in CORE-016 enhanced description.

2. **AAWP_MAT overlay OVL-AM-004 (version header cross-reference)**: Add a check: "For each delivered governance document claiming a version bump in its change log/change note, verify that the `**Version**:` header field at the top of the document matches the claimed version." This would catch the impl-plan.md v1.9.0/v2.0.0 and builder-contract.md v3.1.0/v3.2.0 discrepancies systematically, rather than relying on CORE-007's general inconsistency check.

3. **Foreman session memory truthfulness check**: Consider adding to the AAWP_MAT overlay a check that verifies each file listed as "✅ CREATED" in the Foreman session memory's "Wave Governance Artifacts Created" table actually exists in the repository. This would immediately detect phantom file creation claims.
