# IAA Session Memory — Session 023 — 2026-03-01

## Session Identity
- session_id: session-023-20260301
- date: 2026-03-01
- agent_version: 6.2.0
- contract_version: 2.0.0
- invocation_type: PRE-MERGE — correctly invoked by foreman-v2-agent (session-076) before PR open
- adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict: PHASE_B_BLOCKING

---

## Phase 1 Preflight Record

**bootstrap_directive_complied**: YES — agent-bootstrap-agent_bootstrap called as absolute first action (A-004 attested). No repo files read before contract loaded.

**tier2_knowledge_loaded**: YES
- index.md — v1.2.0 — PRESENT
- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md — v1.2.0 — PRESENT (A-001 through A-006 + A-015 active)
- iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md — v2.1.0 — ACTIVE (CORE-001 to CORE-017)
- iaa-trigger-table.md — v2.0.0 — ACTIVE
- iaa-category-overlays.md — v2.0.0 — ACTIVE
- session-memory-template.md — v1.0.0 — PRESENT

**tier2_gap_flagged**: NO — all files present and active

**canon_inventory_check**: PASS
- Total canons: 188
- Bad hashes: 0
- IAA canon present: YES (INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md — SHA256 verified)

---

## Phase 2 Alignment Record

**invocation_context**:
- PR: copilot/identify-layer-up-candidates — Layer-Up Triage session-076 (trigger: APGI-cmy/maturion-isms#707)
- invoked_by: foreman-v2-agent (session-076)
- work_produced_by: foreman-v2-agent, class: foreman
- artifacts_under_review: 24 layer-up issue specification files + LAYER_UP_CANDIDATES.md (updated) + session-076 memory + PREHANDOVER proof + 2 parking station entries
- wave_type: documentation/planning only — no production code changes

**independence_check**: CONFIRMED — IAA did not produce this work

**pr_category**: AMBIGUOUS (governance planning artifacts in .agent-admin/ — not clearly canon, not clearly doc-only)
→ AMBIGUITY RULE applied → IAA MANDATORY → Foreman correctly invoked IAA

**iaa_triggered**: YES — AMBIGUITY RULE
**foreman_builder_mandate_check**: APPLICABLE — Foreman-class agent contract work reviewed; invocation mandatory per AGCFPP-001

**fail_only_once_a006_check**: PENDING state in iaa_audit_token — NOT PHASE_A_ADVISORY FABRICATION. Correct pre-audit ceremony.

## Phase 3 Assurance Work Record

**checks_executed**: 15
**checks_passed**: 14
**checks_failed**: 1

### Core Invariants Applied

| Check | Applicable | Verdict | Notes |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------|
| CORE-001 to CORE-004 | NO | N/A | Not AGENT_CONTRACT (no .github/agents/ changes) |
| CORE-005 | NO | N/A | Not agent contract |
| CORE-006 | YES | PASS | CANON_INVENTORY unchanged; no canon files touched |
| CORE-007 | YES | PASS | No actual stub/placeholder content; all "stub" mentions are legitimate governance content |
| CORE-008 to CORE-012 | NO | N/A | Not AGENT_CONTRACT |
| CORE-013 | YES | PASS | PREHANDOVER proof present; this IAA session IS the invocation evidence; pre-audit state correct |
| CORE-014 | YES | PASS | No class exemption claimed; Foreman correctly invoked IAA |
| CORE-015 | YES | PASS | Session memory at .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-076-layer-up-triage-20260301.md |
| CORE-016 | YES | PASS | iaa_audit_token: PENDING (not PHASE_A_ADVISORY); correct pre-audit state; A-006 INC-IAA-SKIP-001 NOT triggered |
| CORE-017 | YES | PASS | Zero .github/agents/ modifications confirmed via git status |

### Functional Key Claims Checks

| Check | Verdict | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| FC-1: All 24 specs follow Section 6 format | PASS | Automated scan: all 24 PASS for ## Trigger, ## Evidence, ## Current Governance State, ## Observed Gap/Conflict/Failure, ## Proposed Governance Improvement, ## Impact Assessment, Reference: |
| FC-2: No production code modified | PASS | git status shows only .agent-admin/ and .agent-workspace/ changes |
| FC-3: Session memory complete | PASS | All required fields populated; phase summaries complete |
| FC-4: PREHANDOVER proof complete | PASS | All mandatory sections present; iaa_audit_token: PENDING (correct) |
| FC-5: Triage covers all sources | FAIL | S-003 and S-005 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE improvements reviewed but excluded without documented rationale |
| FC-6: Parking station entries correct | PASS | 2 session-076 entries confirmed in correct format |

---

## Phase 4 Verdict

**merge_gate_parity_result**: PASS
- merge-gate/verdict: PASS (188 entries, 0 bad hashes, IAA canon present)
- governance/alignment: PASS (all 4 required artifacts present)
- stop-and-fix/enforcement: PASS (PREHANDOVER proof present)
- POLC boundary: PASS (zero production code changes)

**verdict**: REJECTION-PACKAGE
**token_reference**: IAA-session-023-20260301-REJECT
**adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict**: PHASE_B_BLOCKING

**failures_cited**:
1. FC-5: S-003 (AAWP deliverable table verification, OPEN) and S-005 (governance-alignment-schedule.yml integration test, OPEN) excluded from issue specs without documented exclusion rationale. Session memory preamble attests review of all 9 improvements (S-001–S-009) but only 7 became specs. Wave claims to cover all outstanding candidates but silently omits 2 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE improvements.
   Fix: Add issue specs 25+26 for S-003 and S-005, OR document explicit exclusion rationale per LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md Section 5 triggers for each.

## Prior Sessions Reviewed

- session-018-20260301: ASSURANCE-TOKEN IAA-073-20260301-PASS
- session-019-20260301: ASSURANCE-TOKEN IAA-session-019-20260301-PASS

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

| Rule | Applied | Outcome |
|------|---------|---------|
| A-001 (IAA invocation evidence) | YES | PASS — PREHANDOVER proof present, this session is the invocation |
| A-002 (no class exceptions) | YES | PASS — Foreman correctly invoked IAA; no exemption claimed |
| A-003 (ambiguity resolves to mandatory) | YES | PASS — AMBIGUOUS category → mandatory invocation; Foreman complied |
| A-004 (bootstrap directive) | YES | PASS — agent_bootstrap called first |
| A-005 (no .github/agents/ modifications) | YES | PASS — zero .github/agents/ changes |
| A-006 (INC-IAA-SKIP-001 detection) | YES | PASS — PENDING ≠ PHASE_A_ADVISORY FABRICATION |
| A-015 (Tier 2 patches require full ceremony) | YES | PASS — N/A to this wave (no Tier 2 patches) |

**fail_only_once_updates**: None this session — FC-5 finding is a wave-completeness issue, not a new governance breach pattern requiring a new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule.

## Learning Notes

1. **Triage waves with multiple sources need explicit exclusion documentation**: When a Foreman triage session reviews N items from a source but only creates M < N specs, the delta must be documented. This session found that 9 items were reviewed but only 7 produced specs — 2 were silently excluded. The session memory should include an "Excluded from triage" section with rationale for each reviewed item that did NOT become a spec, citing LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md Section 5 triggers.

2. **Pre-audit PENDING state is the correct ceremony**: The Foreman correctly used `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` rather than self-certifying. This is the intended pattern — PENDING + actual IAA tool call = correct. Session memory + PREHANDOVER proof both ready before IAA output. A-006 was NOT triggered. The ceremony worked as designed.

3. **S-003 ambiguity re issue-spec-24**: S-003 (AAWP deliverable table verification as mandatory numbered step) is NOT covered by issue-spec-24 (PREHANDOVER template canonization). The two are related but distinct improvements. Future Foreman sessions should not conflate "template structure" (spec-24) with "specific mandatory checklist steps" (S-003).

4. **S-005 may be a legitimate exclusion but needs rationale**: S-005 (integration test for governance-alignment-schedule.yml) is arguably a local CI improvement rather than a canonical governance layer-up candidate. However, since it is OPEN in FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md, its exclusion from the layer-up triage must be explicitly documented.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **S-018 (NEW)**: Add a "Triage Decision Record" subsection to the LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md Phase 1 documentation that mandates: for every FAIL-ONLY-ONCE OPEN improvement reviewed in a triage session, either a spec is created OR an explicit exclusion rationale is written citing the trigger criterion that was not met. This prevents silent gaps in triage completeness.

2. **Continuous improvement**: The 24 issue specs that PASSED all have excellent substantive content (all far above minimum word count). The Section 6 format was applied consistently and correctly across a large set of 24 candidates. The format verification could be added as a CI lint check (S-002 analog for layer-up spec completeness) to catch missing sections automatically.

## Parking Station

```
| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-023 | [PHASE-4] | Layer-up triage waves need explicit "Triage Decision Record" for reviewed items not converted to specs — add to LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md Phase 1 format | session-023-20260301.md |
```
