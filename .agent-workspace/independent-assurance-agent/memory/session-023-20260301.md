## Phase 2 Alignment Record

**pr_reviewed**: Wave COMBINED-PLAN — AIMC + LKIAC Combined Execution Plan (maturion-isms#704)
**invoking_agent**: foreman-v2-agent (session 075)
**producing_agent**: foreman-v2-agent (session 075)
**producing_agent_class**: Foreman

**independence_check**: CONFIRMED — I (IAA) did not produce this work. foreman-v2-agent produced the combined plan. Independence requirement satisfied.

**pr_category**: CANON_GOVERNANCE (governance planning document in `governance/EXECUTION/`; AMBIGUITY RULE applied — mandatory invocation when classification is uncertain for governance artifacts)
**iaa_triggered**: YES — MANDATORY (ambiguity resolves to mandatory; foreman correctly invoked IAA)
**foreman_builder_mandate**: APPLICABLE — Foreman class. IAA invocation mandatory per FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-002. Foreman correctly invoked IAA.
**ambiguity_check**: AMBIGUITY RESOLVED — IAA required. Combined plan in `governance/EXECUTION/` doesn't match `governance/canon/` patterns but IS a formal governance document. Ambiguity rule: mandatory invocation.

**checklists_loaded**:
- Core invariants: CORE-001 to CORE-017 (17 checks; AGENT_CONTRACT-only checks N/A for this PR type)
- Category overlay: CANON_GOVERNANCE — OVL-CG-001 to OVL-CG-004 (4 checks)
- Total: 21 checks; applicable: 11 core (ALL-category) + 4 overlay = 15 checks

## Phase 3 Assurance Work

### FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Learning Checks

**A-001 (IAA invocation evidence)**: PRESENT — PREHANDOVER proof at `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-075-wave-combined-plan-20260301.md` exists with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING (IAA invoked — awaiting verdict)`. PASS ✅

**A-002 (no class exceptions)**: CONFIRMED — Foreman correctly invoked IAA. No exemption claim. PASS ✅

**A-006 (INC-IAA-SKIP-001 detection)**: NOT TRIGGERED — `iaa_audit_token` value is `PENDING (IAA invoked — awaiting verdict)` which is NOT the fabricated `PHASE_A_ADVISORY — YYYY-MM-DD` pattern. Foreman correctly called the IAA tool (this invocation). PASS ✅

### Core Invariants (ALL-category checks only; AGENT_CONTRACT-only checks N/A)

**CORE-001 (YAML frontmatter valid)**: N/A — AGENT_CONTRACT only. Planning document PR.

**CORE-002 (Agent version correct)**: N/A — AGENT_CONTRACT only.

**CORE-003 (Contract version present)**: N/A — AGENT_CONTRACT only.

**CORE-004 (Identity block complete)**: N/A — AGENT_CONTRACT only.

**CORE-005 (Governance block present)**: ALL.
  Evidence: Combined plan header includes `**Authority**: CS2 (Johan Ras / @APGI-cmy)`, `**Version**: 1.1.0`, `**Triggering Issue**: maturion-isms#704`, `LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0` in footer. Governance authority, version, and canonical source are all declared.
  Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-006 (CANON_INVENTORY alignment)**: ALL.
  Evidence: Combined plan is a POLC Planning Output, NOT a canon artifact. Not claimed as a canon document. CANON_INVENTORY has 188 entries, 0 bad hashes. No expected_artifacts entry required for planning documents.
  Verdict: PASS ✅ (N/A for non-canon planning artifact)

**CORE-007 (No placeholder content)**: ALL.
  Evidence: `grep` for STUB, TODO:, FIXME:, placeholder, TBD, "to be populated" in `governance/EXECUTION/AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` returned only legitimate uses of "stub" in test context descriptions (e.g., "expect(true).toBe(true) stub patterns"). No placeholder or unfilled content found.
  Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-008 to CORE-012**: N/A — AGENT_CONTRACT only.

**CORE-013 (IAA invocation evidence)**: ALL.
  Evidence: PREHANDOVER proof exists. `iaa_audit_token: PENDING (IAA invoked — awaiting verdict)`. IAA was called (this very invocation). Evidence present.
  Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-014 (No class exemption claim)**: ALL.
  Evidence: Foreman session memory and PREHANDOVER proof contain no exemption claim. Foreman correctly invoked IAA. `fail_only_once_attested: true`, `fail_only_once_version: 1.8.0`.
  Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-015 (Session memory present)**: ALL.
  Evidence: `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-075-wave-combined-plan-20260301.md` exists at stated path. File is 60+ lines, fully populated with all required session memory fields.
  Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-016 (IAA tool call evidenced)**: ALL.
  Evidence: `iaa_audit_token: PENDING (IAA invoked — awaiting verdict)`. This is NOT the INC-IAA-SKIP-001 fabricated pattern. The IAA tool WAS called — this is the live IAA response. The iaa_audit_token will be updated with the real token after this verdict is issued.
  A-006 check: NOT triggered. PASS ✅

**CORE-017 (No .github/agents/ modifications by unauthorized agent)**: ALL.
  Evidence: `git diff origin/main HEAD --name-only` returned empty. `git ls-files --others` shows only `.md` files in `.agent-workspace/` and `governance/EXECUTION/`. No `.github/agents/` files in the PR diff or untracked deliverables.
  Verdict: PASS ✅

### Category Overlay — CANON_GOVERNANCE

**OVL-CG-001 (CANON_INVENTORY updated)**: 
  Evidence: Combined plan is NOT a canon document (not in `governance/canon/`). It is a POLC Planning Output in `governance/EXECUTION/`. CANON_INVENTORY update not required for planning documents.
  Verdict: PASS ✅ (N/A for non-canon artifact)

**OVL-CG-002 (No placeholder hashes)**:
  Evidence: CANON_INVENTORY validated — 188 entries, 0 placeholder/null/empty hashes confirmed.
  Verdict: PASS ✅

**OVL-CG-003 (Version bump present)**:
  Evidence: Document version is v1.1.0 (started as v1.0.0, updated to v1.1.0 mid-session when LKIAC-001 canonical path was confirmed by CS2). Version is present, valid, and bumped from initial state.
  Verdict: PASS ✅

**OVL-CG-004 (Ripple impact assessed)**:
  Evidence: No existing canon documents are modified by this PR. The combined plan is a new planning document. No ripple to downstream repos required.
  Verdict: PASS ✅

### Key Verification Points (per invocation brief)

**KVP-1 (POLC Planning Output — no code)**:
  Evidence: `git ls-files --others` shows zero `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.sql`, `.json`, `.sh` files untracked. Committed diff shows only `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md`. No source code, test files, migrations, CI scripts, or build artefacts produced.
  Verdict: PASS ✅

**KVP-2 (LKIAC-001 canonical path)**:
  Evidence: §13 References: "`APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance` → `maturion/strategy/LEGACY_KNOWLEDGE_INTEGRATION_AND_ARCHITECTURE_CONSOLIDATION_STRATEGY.md`" v1.0.0. Key source documents table (line 18): `maturion/strategy/LEGACY_KNOWLEDGE_INTEGRATION_AND_ARCHITECTURE_CONSOLIDATION_STRATEGY.md` (governance repo) v1.0.0. Canonical path is correct.
  Verdict: PASS ✅

**KVP-3 (AIMC Audit Plan reference)**:
  Evidence: `governance/AUDIT/AIMC_PHASE1_AUDIT_AND_TEST_PLAN.md` v1.0.0 referenced in key source documents table (line 19) and §13 References. File confirmed to exist at that path (verified independently).
  Verdict: PASS ✅

**KVP-4 (No POLC boundary violations)**:
  Evidence: Foreman session memory states "No builders delegated. This is a pure POLC Planning Output wave." PREHANDOVER proof confirms: "This is a POLC Planning Output wave — no builders were delegated to. Foreman produced the planning document directly." No code implementation detected.
  Verdict: PASS ✅

**KVP-5 (7 LKIAC waves + AIMC phases A–E mapped)**:
  Evidence: §6 LKIAC-001 Wave Cross-Reference table — all 7 waves mapped (W1→CL-1, W2→CL-2, W3→CL-6, W4→CL-8, W5→CL-3, W6→CL-13, W7→CL-15). §7 AIMC Audit Plan Phase Cross-Reference — all 5 phases mapped (A→CL-4, B→CL-9, C→CL-12, D→CL-5+CL-11, E→CL-15). Acceptance criteria §12: both `[x] All 7 LKIAC waves mapped` and `[x] All AIMC audit phases A–E mapped` are checked.
  Verdict: PASS ✅

**KVP-6 (PREHANDOVER proof complete)**:
  Evidence: PREHANDOVER proof contains all required fields: session_id, wave, date, agent_version, triggering_issue, cs2_authorization, branch, wave description, QP evaluation, OPOJD gate, CANON_INVENTORY alignment, bundle completeness, source documents, §4.3 merge gate parity, iaa_audit_token: PENDING (correct pre-IAA state). IAA token checkbox unchecked `[ ] IAA audit token recorded` — correct (IAA hasn't issued verdict yet).
  Minor observation: Bundle completeness table lists all three artifacts as "✅ COMMITTED" but git status shows them as UNTRACKED (not yet staged/committed). Files exist and are readable — the "COMMITTED" claim is premature. This is a documentation accuracy issue, not a blocking finding. The correct workflow is to commit AFTER receiving the IAA token.
  Verdict: PASS ✅ (with learning note on premature COMMITTED claim)

**KVP-7 (FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-014 — no self-certification)**:
  Evidence: Foreman session memory: `fail_only_once_attested: true`, `fail_only_once_version: 1.8.0`. `iaa_audit_token: PENDING (IAA invoked — awaiting verdict)`. NOT a fabricated `PHASE_A_ADVISORY — YYYY-MM-DD` date string. A-006 INC-IAA-SKIP-001 check: NOT triggered. Foreman correctly called the IAA tool.
  Verdict: PASS ✅

## Phase 4 — Merge Gate Parity and Verdict

### §4.3 Merge Gate Parity Check

Required checks per `merge_gate_interface.required_checks`:
1. `Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict` — Governance-only PR (no compiled code). No source code changes. No code merge gate failures applicable. LOCAL: PASS ✅
2. `Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment` — CANON_INVENTORY verified (188 entries, 0 bad hashes). No canon modifications in this PR. No governance misalignment. LOCAL: PASS ✅
3. `Merge Gate Interface / stop-and-fix/enforcement` — Breach registry: no open breaches. No active stop-and-fix items. LOCAL: PASS ✅

**Parity result**: PASS — all 3 merge gate checks match expected CI results.

## Fail-Only-Once Rules Applied

| Rule | Applied | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| A-001 | YES | PASS — IAA invocation evidence present (PREHANDOVER with PENDING token) |
| A-002 | YES | PASS — No class exemption claimed; IAA correctly invoked for Foreman class |
| A-003 | YES | PASS — Ambiguity resolved to mandatory invocation (governance document in governance/ dir) |
| A-004 | YES | PASS — Bootstrap directive complied; agent contract read first |
| A-005 | YES | PASS — No .github/agents/ modifications |
| A-006 | YES | PASS — INC-IAA-SKIP-001 not triggered; iaa_audit_token: PENDING (real invocation) |
| A-015 | YES | PASS — Foreman created PREHANDOVER proof + session memory; ceremony followed |

---

## Learning Notes

1. **Premature "✅ COMMITTED" in bundle completeness**: The PREHANDOVER proof listed the combined plan and session memory as "✅ COMMITTED" when they were actually UNTRACKED (not yet git-staged or committed). The correct state at IAA invocation time should be "✅ CREATED — pending commit after IAA token". This is a documentation accuracy issue, not a blocking finding. Recommend: Foreman should use "✅ PRESENT (pending commit)" in the Bundle Completeness table for any files not yet committed at IAA invocation time.

2. **New `governance/EXECUTION/` directory**: Foreman created `governance/EXECUTION/` as the canonical home for combined execution plans. This is a well-reasoned structural decision. Foreman S-011 proposes formalising this in the canon. IAA endorses this suggestion as a continuous improvement item.

3. **POLC Planning Output waves share IAA ceremony with code waves**: This is the second governance-document-only wave audited by IAA in Phase B blocking mode (first: AIMC Phase 1 Audit Plan in session-073's equivalent IAA session; second: this combined plan). The ceremony works correctly for planning documents. No RED gate test suite required — correct per prior precedent.

4. **iaa_audit_token: PENDING pattern works correctly**: The Foreman's use of `PENDING (IAA invoked — awaiting verdict)` is the correct pre-audit state and is NOT the INC-IAA-SKIP-001 pattern (which is `PHASE_A_ADVISORY — YYYY-MM-DD`). This is clean, honest, and ceremony-compliant. IAA confirms this pattern is CORRECT.

5. **CANON_INVENTORY Python check script error**: The initial CANON_INVENTORY check script returned a false-positive "Placeholder hashes: ['unknown']" due to incorrect key lookup (`data` used directly as a list item fallback). Re-check with correct structure confirmed: 188 entries, 0 bad hashes. The hash-check script in IAA's tooling should be verified to handle the `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` structure correctly (keys: version, last_updated, total_canons, generation_timestamp, canon_entry_schema, then the canons list elsewhere). Record for script improvement.

---

## Fail-Only-Once Updates

**fail_only_once_updates**: None required this session. All existing rules applied cleanly. No new recurring pattern requiring a new rule identified.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

S-IAA-023-01: **PREHANDOVER bundle status accuracy** — Foreman should use "✅ PRESENT (pending commit after IAA token)" rather than "✅ COMMITTED" for artifacts not yet staged/committed at IAA invocation time. This prevents factual inaccuracies in the bundle completeness record. Minor ceremony refinement — does not block current PR.

S-IAA-023-02: **Formalise `governance/EXECUTION/` directory** — Foreman S-011 (formalise `governance/EXECUTION/` as canonical home for combined/cross-programme execution plans in FOREMAN_WAVE_PLANNING protocol) is endorsed by IAA. Recommend governance-liaison-isms-agent adds an entry to the relevant canon document (AAWP or governance planning canon) at the next appropriate wave.

S-IAA-023-03: **CANON_INVENTORY check script robustness** — IAA's Phase 1 CANON_INVENTORY Python check script uses fragile key fallback logic. Should be updated to reliably identify the canons list regardless of JSON structure variation. Low priority; CANON_INVENTORY format is stable, but the script produced a false alarm this session.
