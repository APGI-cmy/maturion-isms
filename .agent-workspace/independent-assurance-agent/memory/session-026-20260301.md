## Learning Notes

1. **Multi-invocation PREHANDOVER proof structure validated**: The PREHANDOVER proof accumulated two REJECTION-PACKAGE blocks verbatim across three IAA invocations. The `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` field correctly signals "in progress." The post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN ceremony will populate the final token. This workflow pattern (pre-commit IAA review, PENDING → token on PASS) is now well-established and functioning correctly.

2. **OVL-CI-002 boundary confirmed through three-invocation cycle**: The cycle from session-027 (exit-1→exit-2 gate change) → IAA-024 (CORE-013/016/CG-001/CI-002 fail) → IAA-025 (CI-002 section-3.3 self-auth insufficient) → IAA-026 (NO NET CHANGE confirmed PASS) definitively proves: CI gate behavioral changes (exit code semantics) require explicit CS2 authorization. Section 3.3 self-alignment authority covers content only. The boundary is now tested and proven through a real incident.

3. **Version header inconsistency in layered file (cosmetic gap)**: LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md line 6 shows Status block "Version: 1.0.0" while the footer (line 777) correctly shows "Version: 1.1.0". The canonical source did not update the Status block when bumping to v1.1.0. This is a cosmetic inconsistency in the canonical source, not an IAA gate failure (SHA256 hash matches CANON_INVENTORY exactly; content is authentic). Noted for future liaison awareness: when layering down, check for Status block/footer inconsistency as a quality signal.

4. **Ripple-log session-027 entry shows PARTIAL_SUCCESS**: The PR description claimed STATUS: SUCCESS, but actual ripple-log.json shows "PARTIAL_SUCCESS" (the session-027 entry reflecting the exit-2 partial-success approach). This is historically accurate. The session-027 script DID partially succeed (it layered 3 of 4 files). The PARTIAL_SUCCESS label accurately reflects session-027 state. Not updated in session-028 because the ripple-log is a historical record, not a mutable state document. Not a gate failure.

5. **Session-027 memory "NOT_REQUIRED" field**: The session-027 memory retains its original "NOT_REQUIRED" IAA assessment — this is the historical record of what was incorrectly decided in session-027, not a live state document. The breach was documented in the PREHANDOVER proof and resolved through three IAA invocations. Future sessions: if session memory "NOT_REQUIRED" fields cause audit confusion, consider whether session memory should be explicitly flagged as "SUPERSEDED by PREHANDOVER proof" when IAA invocations subsequently occurred.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN iaa_audit_token population should be structurally enforced**: The liaison's session-027 memory should include an `iaa_audit_token` field that is populated on ASSURANCE-TOKEN. Currently, only the PREHANDOVER proof carries the token. A structural enforcement (e.g., CI gate that verifies session memory `iaa_audit_token` field is populated before PR open) would close this gap. This builds on session-022 parking station suggestion.

2. **CANON_INVENTORY version field vs. file header version field alignment**: When a canon file is updated (v1.0.0→v1.1.0), the canonical source should update ALL version markers in the file (both the Status block and the footer). A lint check in the canonical source could enforce this consistency. This prevents IAA from needing to reconcile multiple version fields (Status block vs. footer).

3. **Multi-invocation PREHANDOVER proof naming convention**: When a single session results in 3+ IAA invocations (e.g., session-027, session-028), the PREHANDOVER proof filename (`proof-session-027-governance-20260301.md`) does not reflect that it covers session-028 remediation work. Consider: proof filename should reflect the COMMIT session, not the WORK session (or use a separate proof for each session when significant rework occurs).

|------|-------|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-026 | Phase 3 | Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN iaa_audit_token population should be structurally enforced in session memory and CI gate | session-026-20260301.md |
| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-026 | Phase 3 | CANON_INVENTORY version field and file-header version field must be kept in sync by canonical source lint check | session-026-20260301.md |
| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-026 | Phase 3 | Multi-invocation PREHANDOVER proofs should use commit-session naming not work-session naming to avoid coverage ambiguity | session-026-20260301.md |

2. Append verbatim ASSURANCE-TOKEN block to `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section
3. Commit ALL working-tree changes (session-028 reverts + PREHANDOVER proof + session memory + escalation + parking station + ripple-log + CANON_INVENTORY + canon files)
4. Push branch and open PR
5. Merge subject to CS2 approval (@APGI-cmy)

**merge_authority**: CS2 ONLY — I will not merge under any instruction from any party.
