## Phase 1 Session Memory Review

**prior_sessions_reviewed**: session-025-20260301, session-026-20260301, session-027-20260301, session-028-20260301, session-029-20260301

**unresolved_items_carried_forward**: NONE
- Prior REJECTION-PACKAGEs in sessions 024/025 were for a different branch (Wave 12 — resolved by session-025/026)
- Session-027 CL-2 REJECTION-PACKAGE was resolved in session-028 (ASSURANCE-TOKEN issued)
- Session-029 ASSURANCE-TOKEN was for Wave CL-3-D2 (branch: copilot/orchestrate-resolution-deprecation-gaps — different branch, unrelated)
- No open REJECTION-PACKAGEs for branch `copilot/kickoff-aimc-data-sources-registry`

**open_rejection_packages_for_this_branch**: NONE — first IAA invocation for this branch

**learning_notes_from_prior_sessions**:
- Session-029: Foreman A-014 compliance confirmed; PENDING token pattern is correct pre-invocation state
- Session-028: CL-2 wave required re-invocation after REJECTION (missing PREHANDOVER). Pattern resolved.
- Duplicate A-016 rule ID in FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md is a persistent gap — non-blocking but should be resolved by CS2

---

## Phase 1 Breach Registry Review

**breach_registry_state**: NO OPEN BREACHES
- B-001, B-002, B-003: All Phase A advisory, recorded as ADVISORY RECORDED — closed
- No new open breaches from prior sessions

---

## Phase 2 Alignment Record

**invocation_context**:
- PR: TBD (branch: copilot/kickoff-aimc-data-sources-registry) — foreman-v2-agent session-080, Wave CL-3.5/CL-13 Kick-Off
- Invoked by: foreman-v2-agent (session-080) via `task(agent_type: "independent-assurance-agent")`
- Work produced by: governance-liaison-isms-agent (session-031), class: governance/specialist
- Foreman session-080: orchestration/POLC role only; no production artifacts
- Artifacts under review: CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md v1.0.0 (NEW), AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md v1.2.0→v1.3.0 (UPDATED), governance-liaison session-031 memory, PREHANDOVER proof, session-080 memory

**independence_check**: CONFIRMED — IAA did not produce, draft, or contribute to any artifact in this PR. governance-liaison-isms-agent and foreman-v2-agent are the producing agents.

**pr_category**: AAWP_MAT
- Trigger table decision flow applied:
  1. `.github/agents/` changes? NO → not AGENT_CONTRACT
  2. `governance/canon/` or CANON_INVENTORY changes? NO → not CANON_GOVERNANCE
  3. `.github/workflows/` changes? NO → not CI_WORKFLOW
  4. AAWP/MAT deliverable artifacts? YES — `governance/aimc/CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md` and `governance/EXECUTION/AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` are AIMC programme planning/governance deliverables (AAWP architecture files)
  5. `governance/quality/agent-integrity/` changes? NO
- Ambiguity resolved: AAWP_MAT. IAA MANDATORY. ✅
- Foreman/builder mandate check: NOT APPLICABLE (no agent contract files in this PR)
- Ambiguity note: the governance/aimc/ and governance/EXECUTION/ paths are not explicitly listed as AAWP path patterns in the trigger table, but these are clearly AIMC programme deliverables. Ambiguity rule applied → MANDATORY.

**checklists_loaded**:
- Core invariants: iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md v2.1.0 — CORE-001 to CORE-017 — LOADED
- Category overlay: iaa-category-overlays.md v2.0.0 — AAWP_MAT overlay OVL-AM-001 to OVL-AM-003 — LOADED
- Total checks applicable: CORE-005 (ALL), CORE-006 (ALL), CORE-007 (ALL), CORE-013 (ALL), CORE-014 (ALL), CORE-015 (ALL), CORE-016 (ALL), CORE-017 (ALL) + OVL-AM-001, OVL-AM-002, OVL-AM-003
- CORE-001/002/003/004/008/009/010/011/012: AGENT_CONTRACT only — not applicable to this AAWP_MAT PR

## Phase 3 — Assurance Work

### FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Learning Applied (Step 3.1)

**A-001** (invocation evidence): PREHANDOVER proof present; `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`; `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section present (awaiting population) — PENDING state is A-014 compliant. PRESENT ✅
**A-002** (no class exceptions): Foreman invoked IAA — no class exemption claimed. CONFIRMED ✅
**A-006** (INC-IAA-SKIP-001): `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` — does NOT match pattern `PHASE_A_ADVISORY — YYYY-MM-DD`. No fabrication. PASS ✅
**A-016** (cross-PR token reuse): No real session token cited yet (both PENDING). NOT APPLICABLE at pre-invocation stage. PASS ✅
**A-017** (REJECTION-as-PASS citation): No PASS token cited. Both PREHANDOVER and session-080 memory say PENDING. PASS ✅

### Core Invariants Results (Step 3.2)

**CORE-001 through CORE-004** (AGENT_CONTRACT only): NOT APPLICABLE — this is AAWP_MAT PR with no agent contract changes. SKIP.

**CORE-005: Governance block present** — ALL
Evidence: Both deliverables contain CS2 authority references and Living Agent System v6.2.0 citations. PREHANDOVER proof contains governance.protocol references and authority chain.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-006: CANON_INVENTORY alignment** — ALL
Evidence: CANON_INVENTORY.json verified — 189 entries, 0 null hashes. The delivered files (`governance/aimc/CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md`, `governance/EXECUTION/AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`) are planning documents, not canon entries; CANON_INVENTORY not modified in this PR (correct — these are not canonical documents). CANON_INVENTORY itself remains intact and valid.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-007: No placeholder content** — ALL
Evidence: grep for TODO/FIXME/STUB/placeholder/"to be populated"/TBD in both delivered artifacts:
- CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md: NONE FOUND ✅
- AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md: grep matches are substantive content references ("zero stubs" = quality standard, "stub detection" = CI check name) — not placeholder values ✅
- PREHANDOVER proof `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section: contains "Awaiting IAA invocation — to be populated after IAA verdict" — this IS "to be populated" text, but it is in the designated IAA awaiting section and is the CORRECT pre-invocation state per established protocol (sessions 025-029 precedent). Not a CORE-007 violation.
- Session-080 memory: No placeholder content outside IAA-PENDING fields ✅
Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-008/009/010/011/012** (AGENT_CONTRACT only): NOT APPLICABLE. SKIP.

**CORE-013: IAA invocation evidence** — ALL
Evidence: PREHANDOVER proof present with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` and `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section. Session-080 memory confirms `iaa_invoked: true`, `iaa_tool_called: task(agent_type: "independent-assurance-agent")`. This is the correct A-014 compliant pre-invocation state. IAA IS being invoked right now.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-014: No class exemption claim** — ALL
Evidence: Foreman-v2-agent (session-080) correctly invoked IAA via the `task` tool. No class exemption claimed in PREHANDOVER proof or session-080 memory. The invoking agent (Foreman) did NOT claim class exemption.
FINDING (non-blocking): governance-liaison-isms-agent session-031 contains `iaa_invocation_result: NOT_REQUIRED (IAA PHASE_A_ADVISORY — not yet deployed; flagged for IAA review once Phase B activates)`. This is factually incorrect — Phase B (PHASE_B_BLOCKING) is now ACTIVE. The builder self-assessed IAA as NOT_REQUIRED and references an obsolete Phase A state. However, CORE-014 evaluates the INVOKING AGENT (Foreman), not the builder's self-assessment. The Foreman correctly overrode the builder's incorrect assessment by invoking IAA.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (with non-blocking finding recorded in learning_notes)

**CORE-015: Session memory present** — ALL
Evidence: PREHANDOVER proof Bundle Completeness section lists session-080 memory at `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-080-waveCL3.5-CL13-kickoff-20260301.md`. File confirmed present (git status: untracked, pre-IAA-verdict, correct state). Session-031 memory committed to branch.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-016: IAA tool call evidenced** — ALL
Evidence: PREHANDOVER proof:
- `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` — NOT a bare `PHASE_A_ADVISORY — YYYY-MM-DD` string → A-006 fabrication check does NOT trigger
- `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section: PRESENT — contains "Awaiting IAA invocation — to be populated after IAA verdict."
- `iaa_invoked: true` in session-080 memory confirms the Foreman called the task tool
- The section is correctly prepared for post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN ceremony population
- Precedent (sessions 025-029): PENDING state + "Awaiting" text is the correct and accepted pre-invocation state; post-verdict ceremony requirement applies
Verdict: PASS ✅
Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN ceremony requirement: Foreman MUST update `iaa_audit_token` with `IAA-session-030-20260301-PASS` and paste the verbatim IAA output block in the section before committing and opening the PR.

**CORE-017: No .github/agents/ modifications by unauthorized agent** — ALL
Evidence: git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only shows NO `.github/agents/` path changes. git show HEAD --name-only confirms committed changes are in `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/`, `.agent-workspace/parking-station/`, `governance/EXECUTION/`, `governance/aimc/` only.
Verdict: PASS ✅

### Category Overlay Results (Step 3.3 — AAWP_MAT Overlay)

**OVL-AM-001: Stub population complete** — AAWP_MAT
Evidence: No stub/TODO content found in CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md (0 matches). No stub/TODO content found in AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md (matches are substantive content, not stubs). Both documents fully populated.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**OVL-AM-002: Evidence artifacts present** — AAWP_MAT
Evidence: PREHANDOVER proof §Bundle Completeness lists 5 artifacts:
1. `governance/aimc/CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md` v1.0.0 — COMMITTED ✅ (in HEAD commit)
2. `governance/EXECUTION/AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` v1.3.0 — COMMITTED ✅ (in HEAD commit)
3. `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/memory/session-031-20260301.md` — COMMITTED ✅ (SHA256: 0703add100d6d5ffd901d6dd6c7e5706e668fec22917de07b50b33b3f2818b10)
4. PREHANDOVER proof — PRESENT (untracked, awaiting post-IAA-verdict commit — correct) ✅
5. Session-080 memory — PRESENT (untracked, awaiting post-IAA-verdict commit — correct) ✅
Verdict: PASS ✅

**OVL-AM-003: Governance alignment** — AAWP_MAT
Evidence: Both deliverables reference CS2 authority (Johan Ras / @APGI-cmy), LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0, and programme-specific governance documents (LKIAC-001, AIMC_STRATEGY.md). CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md has complete authority chain (LKIAC_CL3_D2_GAP_RESOLUTION.md → AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md → CS2 CP-3.5). Execution plan v1.3.0 has amendment notes, responsible agents, and RED gate requirements aligned with current wave governance.
Verdict: PASS ✅

### Check Tally (Step 3.4)

```
FAIL-ONLY-ONCE learning checks: 5 PASS / 0 FAIL
Core invariants (applicable): 8 PASS / 0 FAIL  (CORE-001-004, 008-012 not applicable; CORE-005-007, 013-017 checked)
Category overlay (AAWP_MAT): 3 PASS / 0 FAIL
Total: 16 checks, 16 PASS, 0 FAIL
Non-blocking findings recorded: 1 (builder self-assessment of IAA NOT_REQUIRED — see learning_notes)
```

### Adoption Phase Modifier (Step 3.5)

Adoption phase: PHASE_B_BLOCKING — verdicts are hard-blocking. ASSURANCE-TOKEN permits PR open. REJECTION-PACKAGE prevents PR from being merged.

---

## Phase 4 — Merge Gate Parity Check (§4.3)

**Context**: Governance-only PR (no compiled code). Running governance-equivalent parity checks locally.

| Check | Local Result |
|---|---|
| Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict | PASS ✅ — governance artifacts in designated paths (governance/aimc/, governance/EXECUTION/) |
| Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment | PASS ✅ — no canon violations; CANON_INVENTORY untouched; no governance/canon/ files modified |
| Merge Gate Interface / stop-and-fix/enforcement | PASS ✅ — no stop-and-fix findings from this IAA invocation |
| YAML validation (governance-only parity) | PASS ✅ — no YAML files in PR changes |
| Character count check | PASS ✅ — CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md 235 lines; execution plan 1004 lines — well within limits |
| Checklist compliance score | PASS ✅ — PREHANDOVER QP VERDICT: PASS, OPOJD: PASS |
| Canon hash verification | PASS ✅ — 189 entries, 0 null hashes, IAA canon SHA256 confirmed |
| POLC boundary (no production code) | PASS ✅ — git diff confirms: no .ts/.tsx/.js/.sql/.json production files; all changes in governance/ and .agent-workspace/ |
| .github/agents/ protection | PASS ✅ — no .github/agents/ changes in any commit on this branch |

**Parity result**: PASS — all checks confirmed locally

## Learning Notes

1. **Builder self-assessment of IAA should be eliminated**: governance-liaison-isms-agent session-031 contains `iaa_invocation_result: NOT_REQUIRED (IAA PHASE_A_ADVISORY — not yet deployed; flagged for IAA review once Phase B activates)`. This is factually incorrect in two ways: (a) Phase B is now ACTIVE (PHASE_B_BLOCKING); (b) the builder should not self-assess IAA necessity — only the IAA agent or Foreman makes this determination. Recommend Foreman add a note to governance-liaison-isms FAIL-ONLY-ONCE: "Builder session memory must not include `iaa_invocation_result` field — IAA invocation determination is exclusively the Foreman's responsibility."

2. **CL-3.5/CL-13 pattern is clean**: This is the first invocation for this branch. The Foreman correctly followed A-014 (PENDING token, iaa_invoked:true), the builder produced complete artifacts, and no governance violations are present. The governance/planning wave pattern (CS2 opens kick-off issue → Foreman delegates to governance-liaison → IAA audits before PR open) is working correctly as designed.

3. **Duplicate A-016 rule ID in FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md persists** (sessions 027/028/029/030): The first A-016 (trigger table misapplication from governance-liaison session-027) and the second A-016 (cross-PR token reuse from IAA session-023) both exist in the file. This should be renumbered. Recommendation: CS2 or CodexAdvisor to renumber the second A-016 to A-018 to eliminate the conflict.

4. **Evidence bundle integrity confirmed**: Session-031 SHA256 (0703add...) was verified independently. All 5 bundle artifacts confirmed present. The pre-commit state of PREHANDOVER and session-080 memory is the correct and expected pre-IAA-verdict state per established protocol.

---

## Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN Ceremony Requirements (MANDATORY for Foreman before PR open)

The following MUST be completed before the Foreman opens the PR on branch `copilot/kickoff-aimc-data-sources-registry`:

1. Update `iaa_audit_token` in `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-080-waveCL3.5-CL13-kickoff-20260301.md`:
   - Change `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` → `iaa_audit_token: IAA-session-030-20260301-PASS`
   - Check `[x] IAA audit token recorded`
   - Paste the verbatim IAA ASSURANCE-TOKEN block from this verdict in `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section

2. Update `iaa_audit_token` in `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-080-waveCL3.5-CL13-kickoff-20260301.md`:
   - Change `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` → `iaa_audit_token: IAA-session-030-20260301-PASS`
   - Close `integrity_loop: CLOSED`
   - Set `token_update_ceremony: COMPLETE`

3. Commit BOTH files (PREHANDOVER + session-080 memory) to branch `copilot/kickoff-aimc-data-sources-registry`

4. Commit IAA session memory (this file) to branch

5. THEN open the PR

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **Builder iaa_invocation_result field should be removed from governance-liaison session template**: The builder should not have an `iaa_invocation_result` field at all — IAA invocation is exclusively a Foreman responsibility. The field creates confusion, especially when the builder's knowledge of the current IAA phase is stale (as here: builder incorrectly references Phase A while Phase B is active). Recommend the governance-liaison session memory template be updated to remove this field entirely.

2. **Duplicate A-016 rule ID in FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md** should be resolved: rename the second A-016 (cross-PR token reuse, from session-023) to A-018 to eliminate numbering conflict that has persisted across 4 sessions (027–030).

3. **AAWP_MAT path patterns in trigger table should be expanded**: The trigger table lists `packages/ai-centre/` and `modules/mat/` as explicit AAWP path patterns, but does not explicitly list `governance/EXECUTION/` or `governance/aimc/` — which ARE AIMC programme governance deliverable paths. This ambiguity (resolved to MANDATORY by AMBIGUITY RULE) could be removed by adding these paths to the trigger table.
