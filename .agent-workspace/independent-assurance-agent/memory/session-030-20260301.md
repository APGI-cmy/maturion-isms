## Phase 2 Alignment Record

**invocation_context**:
- PR: TBD (branch: copilot/kickoff-aimc-data-sources-registry) — foreman-v2-agent session-080, Wave CL-3.5/CL-13 Kick-Off
- Invoked by: foreman-v2-agent (session-080) via `task(agent_type: "independent-assurance-agent")`
- Work produced by: governance-liaison-isms-agent (session-031), class: governance/specialist
- Foreman session-080: orchestration/POLC role only; no production artifacts
- Artifacts under review: CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md v1.0.0 (NEW), AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md v1.2.0→v1.3.0 (UPDATED), governance-liaison session-031 memory, PREHANDOVER proof, session-080 memory

**independence_check**: CONFIRMED — IAA did not produce, draft, or contribute to any artifact in this PR. governance-liaison-isms-agent and foreman-v2-agent are the producing agents.

**pr_category**: AAWP_MAT
- Trigger table decision flow applied:
  1. `.github/agents/` changes? NO → not AGENT_CONTRACT
  2. `governance/canon/` or CANON_INVENTORY changes? NO → not CANON_GOVERNANCE
  3. `.github/workflows/` changes? NO → not CI_WORKFLOW
  4. AAWP/MAT deliverable artifacts? YES — `governance/aimc/CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md` and `governance/EXECUTION/AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` are AIMC programme planning/governance deliverables (AAWP architecture files)
  5. `governance/quality/agent-integrity/` changes? NO
- Ambiguity resolved: AAWP_MAT. IAA MANDATORY. ✅
- Foreman/builder mandate check: NOT APPLICABLE (no agent contract files in this PR)
- Ambiguity note: the governance/aimc/ and governance/EXECUTION/ paths are not explicitly listed as AAWP path patterns in the trigger table, but these are clearly AIMC programme deliverables. Ambiguity rule applied → MANDATORY.

**checklists_loaded**:
- Core invariants: iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md v2.1.0 — CORE-001 to CORE-017 — LOADED
- Category overlay: iaa-category-overlays.md v2.0.0 — AAWP_MAT overlay OVL-AM-001 to OVL-AM-003 — LOADED
- Total checks applicable: CORE-005 (ALL), CORE-006 (ALL), CORE-007 (ALL), CORE-013 (ALL), CORE-014 (ALL), CORE-015 (ALL), CORE-016 (ALL), CORE-017 (ALL) + OVL-AM-001, OVL-AM-002, OVL-AM-003
- CORE-001/002/003/004/008/009/010/011/012: AGENT_CONTRACT only — not applicable to this AAWP_MAT PR

## Phase 3 — Assurance Work

### FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Learning Applied (Step 3.1)

**A-001** (invocation evidence): PREHANDOVER proof present; `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`; `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section present (awaiting population) — PENDING state is A-014 compliant. PRESENT ✅
**A-002** (no class exceptions): Foreman invoked IAA — no class exemption claimed. CONFIRMED ✅
**A-006** (INC-IAA-SKIP-001): `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` — does NOT match pattern `PHASE_A_ADVISORY — YYYY-MM-DD`. No fabrication. PASS ✅
**A-016** (cross-PR token reuse): No real session token cited yet (both PENDING). NOT APPLICABLE at pre-invocation stage. PASS ✅
**A-017** (REJECTION-as-PASS citation): No PASS token cited. Both PREHANDOVER and session-080 memory say PENDING. PASS ✅

### Core Invariants Results (Step 3.2)

**CORE-001 through CORE-004** (AGENT_CONTRACT only): NOT APPLICABLE — this is AAWP_MAT PR with no agent contract changes. SKIP.

**CORE-005: Governance block present** — ALL
Evidence: Both deliverables contain CS2 authority references and Living Agent System v6.2.0 citations. PREHANDOVER proof contains governance.protocol references and authority chain.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-006: CANON_INVENTORY alignment** — ALL
Evidence: CANON_INVENTORY.json verified — 189 entries, 0 null hashes. The delivered files (`governance/aimc/CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md`, `governance/EXECUTION/AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`) are planning documents, not canon entries; CANON_INVENTORY not modified in this PR (correct — these are not canonical documents). CANON_INVENTORY itself remains intact and valid.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-007: No placeholder content** — ALL
Evidence: grep for TODO/FIXME/STUB/placeholder/"to be populated"/TBD in both delivered artifacts:
- CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md: NONE FOUND ✅
- AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md: grep matches are substantive content references ("zero stubs" = quality standard, "stub detection" = CI check name) — not placeholder values ✅
- PREHANDOVER proof `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section: contains "Awaiting IAA invocation — to be populated after IAA verdict" — this IS "to be populated" text, but it is in the designated IAA awaiting section and is the CORRECT pre-invocation state per established protocol (sessions 025-029 precedent). Not a CORE-007 violation.
- Session-080 memory: No placeholder content outside IAA-PENDING fields ✅
Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-008/009/010/011/012** (AGENT_CONTRACT only): NOT APPLICABLE. SKIP.

**CORE-013: IAA invocation evidence** — ALL
Evidence: PREHANDOVER proof present with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` and `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section. Session-080 memory confirms `iaa_invoked: true`, `iaa_tool_called: task(agent_type: "independent-assurance-agent")`. This is the correct A-014 compliant pre-invocation state. IAA IS being invoked right now.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-014: No class exemption claim** — ALL
Evidence: Foreman-v2-agent (session-080) correctly invoked IAA via the `task` tool. No class exemption claimed in PREHANDOVER proof or session-080 memory. The invoking agent (Foreman) did NOT claim class exemption.
FINDING (non-blocking): governance-liaison-isms-agent session-031 contains `iaa_invocation_result: NOT_REQUIRED (IAA PHASE_A_ADVISORY — not yet deployed; flagged for IAA review once Phase B activates)`. This is factually incorrect — Phase B (PHASE_B_BLOCKING) is now ACTIVE. The builder self-assessed IAA as NOT_REQUIRED and references an obsolete Phase A state. However, CORE-014 evaluates the INVOKING AGENT (Foreman), not the builder's self-assessment. The Foreman correctly overrode the builder's incorrect assessment by invoking IAA.
Verdict: PASS ✅ (with non-blocking finding recorded in learning_notes)

**CORE-015: Session memory present** — ALL
Evidence: PREHANDOVER proof Bundle Completeness section lists session-080 memory at `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-080-waveCL3.5-CL13-kickoff-20260301.md`. File confirmed present (git status: untracked, pre-IAA-verdict, correct state). Session-031 memory committed to branch.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-016: IAA tool call evidenced** — ALL
Evidence: PREHANDOVER proof:
- `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` — NOT a bare `PHASE_A_ADVISORY — YYYY-MM-DD` string → A-006 fabrication check does NOT trigger
- `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section: PRESENT — contains "Awaiting IAA invocation — to be populated after IAA verdict."
- `iaa_invoked: true` in session-080 memory confirms the Foreman called the task tool
- The section is correctly prepared for post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN ceremony population
- Precedent (sessions 025-029): PENDING state + "Awaiting" text is the correct and accepted pre-invocation state; post-verdict ceremony requirement applies
Verdict: PASS ✅
Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN ceremony requirement: Foreman MUST update `iaa_audit_token` with `IAA-session-030-20260301-PASS` and paste the verbatim IAA output block in the section before committing and opening the PR.

**CORE-017: No .github/agents/ modifications by unauthorized agent** — ALL
Evidence: git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only shows NO `.github/agents/` path changes. git show HEAD --name-only confirms committed changes are in `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/`, `.agent-workspace/parking-station/`, `governance/EXECUTION/`, `governance/aimc/` only.
Verdict: PASS ✅

### Category Overlay Results (Step 3.3 — AAWP_MAT Overlay)

**OVL-AM-001: Stub population complete** — AAWP_MAT
Evidence: No stub/TODO content found in CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md (0 matches). No stub/TODO content found in AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md (matches are substantive content, not stubs). Both documents fully populated.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**OVL-AM-002: Evidence artifacts present** — AAWP_MAT
Evidence: PREHANDOVER proof §Bundle Completeness lists 5 artifacts:
1. `governance/aimc/CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md` v1.0.0 — COMMITTED ✅ (in HEAD commit)
2. `governance/EXECUTION/AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` v1.3.0 — COMMITTED ✅ (in HEAD commit)
3. `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/memory/session-031-20260301.md` — COMMITTED ✅ (SHA256: 0703add100d6d5ffd901d6dd6c7e5706e668fec22917de07b50b33b3f2818b10)
4. PREHANDOVER proof — PRESENT (untracked, awaiting post-IAA-verdict commit — correct) ✅
5. Session-080 memory — PRESENT (untracked, awaiting post-IAA-verdict commit — correct) ✅
Verdict: PASS ✅

**OVL-AM-003: Governance alignment** — AAWP_MAT
Evidence: Both deliverables reference CS2 authority (Johan Ras / @APGI-cmy), LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0, and programme-specific governance documents (LKIAC-001, AIMC_STRATEGY.md). CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md has complete authority chain (LKIAC_CL3_D2_GAP_RESOLUTION.md → AIMC_LKIAC_COMBINED_EXECUTION_PLAN.md → CS2 CP-3.5). Execution plan v1.3.0 has amendment notes, responsible agents, and RED gate requirements aligned with current wave governance.
Verdict: PASS ✅

### Check Tally (Step 3.4)

```
FAIL-ONLY-ONCE learning checks: 5 PASS / 0 FAIL
Core invariants (applicable): 8 PASS / 0 FAIL  (CORE-001-004, 008-012 not applicable; CORE-005-007, 013-017 checked)
Category overlay (AAWP_MAT): 3 PASS / 0 FAIL
Total: 16 checks, 16 PASS, 0 FAIL
Non-blocking findings recorded: 1 (builder self-assessment of IAA NOT_REQUIRED — see learning_notes)
```

### Adoption Phase Modifier (Step 3.5)

Adoption phase: PHASE_B_BLOCKING — verdicts are hard-blocking. ASSURANCE-TOKEN permits PR open. REJECTION-PACKAGE prevents PR from being merged.

---

## Phase 4 — Merge Gate Parity Check (§4.3)

**Context**: Governance-only PR (no compiled code). Running governance-equivalent parity checks locally.

| Check | Local Result |
|---|---|
| Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict | PASS ✅ — governance artifacts in designated paths (governance/aimc/, governance/EXECUTION/) |
| Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment | PASS ✅ — no canon violations; CANON_INVENTORY untouched; no governance/canon/ files modified |
| Merge Gate Interface / stop-and-fix/enforcement | PASS ✅ — no stop-and-fix findings from this IAA invocation |
| YAML validation (governance-only parity) | PASS ✅ — no YAML files in PR changes |
| Character count check | PASS ✅ — CL3_5_DATA_MODEL_SPEC.md 235 lines; execution plan 1004 lines — well within limits |
| Checklist compliance score | PASS ✅ — PREHANDOVER QP VERDICT: PASS, OPOJD: PASS |
| Canon hash verification | PASS ✅ — 189 entries, 0 null hashes, IAA canon SHA256 confirmed |
| POLC boundary (no production code) | PASS ✅ — git diff confirms: no .ts/.tsx/.js/.sql/.json production files; all changes in governance/ and .agent-workspace/ |
| .github/agents/ protection | PASS ✅ — no .github/agents/ changes in any commit on this branch |

**Parity result**: PASS — all checks confirmed locally

## Learning Notes

1. **Builder self-assessment of IAA should be eliminated**: governance-liaison-isms-agent session-031 contains `iaa_invocation_result: NOT_REQUIRED (IAA PHASE_A_ADVISORY — not yet deployed; flagged for IAA review once Phase B activates)`. This is factually incorrect in two ways: (a) Phase B is now ACTIVE (PHASE_B_BLOCKING); (b) the builder should not self-assess IAA necessity — only the IAA agent or Foreman makes this determination. Recommend Foreman add a note to governance-liaison-isms FAIL-ONLY-ONCE: "Builder session memory must not include `iaa_invocation_result` field — IAA invocation determination is exclusively the Foreman's responsibility."

2. **CL-3.5/CL-13 pattern is clean**: This is the first invocation for this branch. The Foreman correctly followed A-014 (PENDING token, iaa_invoked:true), the builder produced complete artifacts, and no governance violations are present. The governance/planning wave pattern (CS2 opens kick-off issue → Foreman delegates to governance-liaison → IAA audits before PR open) is working correctly as designed.

3. **Duplicate A-016 rule ID in FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md persists** (sessions 027/028/029/030): The first A-016 (trigger table misapplication from governance-liaison session-027) and the second A-016 (cross-PR token reuse from IAA session-023) both exist in the file. This should be renumbered. Recommendation: CS2 or CodexAdvisor to renumber the second A-016 to A-018 to eliminate the conflict.

4. **Evidence bundle integrity confirmed**: Session-031 SHA256 (0703add...) was verified independently. All 5 bundle artifacts confirmed present. The pre-commit state of PREHANDOVER and session-080 memory is the correct and expected pre-IAA-verdict state per established protocol.

---

## Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN Ceremony Requirements (MANDATORY for Foreman before PR open)

The following MUST be completed before the Foreman opens the PR on branch `copilot/kickoff-aimc-data-sources-registry`:

1. Update `iaa_audit_token` in `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-080-waveCL3.5-CL13-kickoff-20260301.md`:
   - Change `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` → `iaa_audit_token: IAA-session-030-20260301-PASS`
   - Check `[x] IAA audit token recorded`
   - Paste the verbatim IAA ASSURANCE-TOKEN block from this verdict in `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section

2. Update `iaa_audit_token` in `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-080-waveCL3.5-CL13-kickoff-20260301.md`:
   - Change `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` → `iaa_audit_token: IAA-session-030-20260301-PASS`
   - Close `integrity_loop: CLOSED`
   - Set `token_update_ceremony: COMPLETE`

3. Commit BOTH files (PREHANDOVER + session-080 memory) to branch `copilot/kickoff-aimc-data-sources-registry`

4. Commit IAA session memory (this file) to branch

5. THEN open the PR
**pr_reviewed**: Wave 12 Amendment — Render Platform Migration (AWS ECS/ECR → Render) — branch copilot/update-deploy-mat-ai-gateway-workflow — PR #743
**invoking_agent**: foreman-v2-agent (session-081)
**producing_agents**: api-builder (workflow implementation), foreman-v2-agent (session artifacts: PREHANDOVER proof, session memory)
**producing_agent_classes**: builder (api-builder), foreman (foreman-v2-agent)
**pr_category**: CI_WORKFLOW
**iaa_triggered**: YES — .github/workflows/ change is mandatory trigger per trigger table
**independence_confirmed**: YES — IAA did not produce the workflow, ecs-task-def.json deletion, PREHANDOVER proof, or session memory

| OVL-CI-004 | PASS ✅ | Workflow correctly implements Render deployment policy: correct trigger, job chain, Render API calls, poll loop, health check, deploy-production push-only gate, cwt after deploy |

### Additional Acceptance Criteria
| Criterion | Verdict | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| AC-1: No AWS/ECS/ECR references | PASS ✅ | Targeted grep clean; "ecr" match in broad grep was false positive from word "secrets" |
| AC-2: lint + test jobs, no secrets | PASS ✅ | Both present; no env secrets in lint or test jobs |
| AC-3: deploy-production Render secrets only | PASS ✅ | RENDER_API_KEY(×2), RENDER_SERVICE_ID(×2), RENDER_SERVICE_URL(×1) — 5 total, all 3 Render secrets only |
| AC-4: cwt after deploy-production | PASS ✅ | cwt.needs: [deploy-production]; only runs on push to main |

## Post-Ceremony Requirements for Foreman

After receiving this ASSURANCE-TOKEN, foreman-v2-agent must complete the ceremony:
1. Update `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` in PREHANDOVER proof to `iaa_audit_token: IAA-session-030-20260301-PASS`
2. Populate `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section with the verbatim ASSURANCE-TOKEN block from this IAA output
3. Commit PREHANDOVER proof to branch (currently untracked)
4. Open PR #743

## fail_only_once_updates

No new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rules required this session. All checks passed. No new governance failure patterns observed.

---

## Learning Notes

**L-001**: POLC self-reporting pattern is positive. Foreman session-081 self-reported the pre-Phase1 implementation breach (FM-SELF-IMPL-081-001) rather than concealing it. This is the correct governance behaviour. The breach was recorded in session memory with full detail, corrective action documented, and status REMEDIATED. IAA should continue to treat self-reported breaches with documented corrective action as REMEDIATED rather than creating new blocking failures.

**L-002**: Session memory agent outcome "PENDING → TBD" inconsistency. The agents_delegated_to table in session-081 session memory shows api-builder outcome as "PENDING → TBD" while the PREHANDOVER proof (the authoritative QP artifact) shows "DELIVERED — QP: PASS". This inconsistency suggests the session memory was finalized before api-builder's task completed and not updated afterward. This is a minor documentation hygiene gap but not a governance blocker since the PREHANDOVER proof is the authoritative deliverable tracker. Note for future: IAA should accept PREHANDOVER proof as authoritative over session memory for builder delivery status.

**L-003**: False positive in broad AWS grep check. Pattern `(aws|ecs|ecr|fargate|aws-actions|amazon)` with `-i` flag matches "ecr" in the word "secrets" (s-**ecr**-ets). Future audits should use targeted patterns for real AWS references rather than the broad pattern. Targeted check confirmed no real AWS references. This is an IAA tooling improvement opportunity.

**L-004**: git provenance limitation for pre-commit audits. Because the changes are staged but not committed, git history cannot confirm which specific agent made the staged edits. Pre-commit IAA invocations must rely on session memory and PREHANDOVER proof for POLC boundary verification rather than git commit authorship. This is expected and documented — the two-phase commit pattern means IAA runs before the commit is made.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **Builder iaa_invocation_result field should be removed from governance-liaison session template**: The builder should not have an `iaa_invocation_result` field at all — IAA invocation is exclusively a Foreman responsibility. The field creates confusion, especially when the builder's knowledge of the current IAA phase is stale (as here: builder incorrectly references Phase A while Phase B is active). Recommend the governance-liaison session memory template be updated to remove this field entirely.

2. **Duplicate A-016 rule ID in FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md** should be resolved: rename the second A-016 (cross-PR token reuse, from session-023) to A-018 to eliminate numbering conflict that has persisted across 4 sessions (027–030).

3. **AAWP_MAT path patterns in trigger table should be expanded**: The trigger table lists `packages/ai-centre/` and `modules/mat/` as explicit AAWP path patterns, but does not explicitly list `governance/EXECUTION/` or `governance/aimc/` — which ARE AIMC programme governance deliverable paths. This ambiguity (resolved to MANDATORY by AMBIGUITY RULE) could be removed by adding these paths to the trigger table.

```
| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-030 | [Phase 4] | Remove iaa_invocation_result field from governance-liaison session memory template — builder should not self-assess IAA necessity | session-030-20260301.md |
| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-030 | [Phase 4] | Rename second A-016 in FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md to A-018 to resolve duplicate rule ID conflict (persists sessions 027-030) | session-030-20260301.md |
| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-030 | [Phase 4] | Expand AAWP_MAT path patterns in trigger table to include governance/EXECUTION/ and governance/aimc/ paths | session-030-20260301.md |
```
**S-001 (carry forward S-011)**: CodexAdvisor should deduplicate the FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md duplicate rule IDs (A-004×2, A-016×2). Both duplicates are functionally distinct rules that need distinct IDs. Suggested resolution: rename the second A-004 to A-018, rename the second A-016 to A-019, and update FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md version to 1.3.0.

**S-002 (new — tooling improvement)**: Add a dedicated IAA check function for AWS reference detection that uses targeted patterns rather than broad substring matching. The pattern `(aws|ecs|ecr|fargate)` with `-i` produces false positives from the word "secrets". Targeted patterns (e.g., `aws-actions/`, `ecr.amazonaws.com`, `ECS_TASK_DEFINITION`, `configure-aws-credentials`) are more accurate and should be standardised in the iaa-category-overlays.md OVL-CI-004 guidance.

**S-003 (new)**: The deployment architecture documentation gap (noted by foreman-v2-agent in session-081 suggestions) should be escalated: `deployment-architecture.md` should be updated to reflect Render as the production platform. This prevents future session 080-type mismatch where a builder implements the wrong platform. Consider adding this to the foreman's FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry as well.
