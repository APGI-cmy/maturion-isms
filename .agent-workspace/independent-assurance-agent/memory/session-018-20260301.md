## Invocation Context

- pr_reviewed: Wave 11 Module Lifecycle Documentation & Progress Tracker Update (session-073, 2026-03-01)
- invoking_agent: foreman-v2-agent (session-073)
- producing_agent: foreman-v2-agent (session-073)
- producing_agent_class: foreman
- invocation_type: PRE-MERGE — Phase B BLOCKING — foreman called IAA BEFORE writing iaa_audit_token (A-014 compliant)
- artifacts_reviewed:
  - modules/mat/03-implementation-plan/implementation-plan.md (v1.9.0 — Wave 11 §2.12 added)
  - modules/mat/BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md (Wave 11 section added)

---

## Classification

- pr_category: AAWP_MAT
- classification_rationale: Two MAT module planning artifacts modified (implementation plan, progress tracker). No .github/agents/, governance/canon/, or .github/workflows/ files in diff. MAT planning artifacts → AAWP_MAT per trigger table. Ambiguity rule (A-003) applied in direction of mandatory invocation.
- ambiguity_rule_applied: YES (direction: mandatory invocation) — "documentation-only" could argue EXEMPT but AAWP_MAT is the correct classification for substantive MAT planning governance artifacts
- foreman_builder_mandate_applied: NOT APPLICABLE — AAWP_MAT category; no agent contract files in diff
- files_in_diff:
  - modules/mat/03-implementation-plan/implementation-plan.md (MODIFIED — Wave 11 §2.12 added, v1.9.0)
  - modules/mat/BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md (MODIFIED — Wave 11 section added, session-073 reference updated)

---

## Adoption Phase

- adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict: PHASE_B_BLOCKING
- IAA is in Phase B. This audit is hard-blocking. Merge authority: CS2 ONLY.

---

## Checks Executed

- checks_executed: 16 (+ 9 N/A with explicit justification)
- fail_only_once_checks: 5 (A-001, A-002, A-003, A-004, A-005)
- core_invariants_applicable: CORE-005, CORE-006, CORE-007, CORE-013, CORE-014, CORE-015 (6 applicable)
- core_invariants_not_applicable: CORE-001 through CORE-004, CORE-008 through CORE-012 (9 — AGENT_CONTRACT-specific, N/A for AAWP_MAT)
- category_overlay_checks: 3 (OVL-AM-001, OVL-AM-002, OVL-AM-003)
- merge_gate_parity_checks: 3

## Results

- checks_passed: 16
- checks_failed: 0
- merge_gate_parity_result: PASS

## Merge Gate Parity Detail (§4.3)

1. **Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict** — LOCAL: PASS ✅
   - CANON_INVENTORY: 188 canons, 0 bad hashes
   - Implementation-plan.md v1.9.0 confirmed
   - Wave 11 §2.12 substantive and complete

2. **Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment** — LOCAL: PASS ✅
   - IAA canon present and AGCFPP-001 present
   - ai-architecture.md v3.0.0 FROZEN confirmed
   - Cross-references consistent across both artifacts

3. **Merge Gate Interface / stop-and-fix/enforcement** — LOCAL: PASS ✅
   - No open breaches (breach-registry.md: 0 open entries)
   - POLC boundary maintained: foreman updated planning artifacts ONLY
   - Zero production code, tests, schemas, or CI files in diff

---

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

- A-001 (IAA invocation evidence): Foreman called IAA via task tool BEFORE writing token. PASS. Mandatory condition: PREHANDOVER proof with token reference must be in PR bundle.
- A-002 (no-class-exceptions): AAWP_MAT category — no agent contract. Foreman correctly invoked IAA. PASS.
- A-003 (ambiguity resolves to mandatory): Applied in direction of mandatory invocation. AAWP_MAT triggered. PASS.
- A-004 (bootstrap first): Contract read as first action. PASS.
- A-005 (no .github/agents/ modifications): git diff confirms zero .github/agents/ files. PASS.

- fail_only_once_updates: See learning_notes below — one new pattern identified but not yet warranting a new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule (observation only).

---

## Mandatory PR Bundle Conditions (post-token)

The following are NOT failures but are MANDATORY before the PR is opened:

1. **PREHANDOVER proof for session-073**: Must be committed to the PR bundle with IAA-073-20260301-PASS token reference. Must include verbatim IAA response per S-009 (INC-IAA-SKIP-001 remediation). Expected path: .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-073-20260301.md (or equivalent).

2. **Foreman session-073 memory**: Must be committed to the PR bundle. Expected path: .agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-073-wave11-governance-20260301.md

These conditions are required for CORE-013 and CORE-015 compliance at the time of PR open.

---

## Verdict

- verdict: ASSURANCE-TOKEN
- token_reference: IAA-073-20260301-PASS
- all_checks_pass: true
- merge_permitted: true (subject to CS2 approval and mandatory PR bundle conditions satisfied)
- adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict: PHASE_B_BLOCKING

## Learning Notes

1. **Governance-only wave IAA invocation pattern**: When a foreman session delivers ONLY planning/governance document updates (implementation plan, progress tracker) with zero production code, the PR category is AAWP_MAT (not EXEMPT). The distinction: MAT planning artifacts with substantive content (task specs, test IDs, architecture refs) are AAWP_MAT deliverables. True EXEMPT would be README edits, parking station entries, or session memory files only.

2. **Pre-token invocation with no PREHANDOVER proof**: When A-014 is correctly followed (IAA called BEFORE writing iaa_audit_token), the PREHANDOVER proof cannot yet exist. CORE-013 and CORE-015 are evaluated as conditional PASS — the token is issued for the CONTENT reviewed, and the PREHANDOVER proof / session memory are expected post-token artifacts in the PR bundle. This is the correct timing sequence and should not trigger a FAIL. The mandatory conditions are recorded in session memory and surfaced to the foreman explicitly.

3. **INC-IAA-SKIP-001 institutional learning correctly applied**: The Wave 11 §2.12 section explicitly references INC-IAA-SKIP-001 and A-014, and mandates verbatim IAA response in the Wave 11 PREHANDOVER proof. This demonstrates successful learning integration from Wave 10 RCA (session-072). IAA should monitor subsequent waves to confirm this pattern holds.

4. **Cross-wave learning explicit capture pattern**: The implementation plan §2.12 and BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER Wave 11 section both explicitly document cross-wave learning outcomes (INC-IAA-SKIP-001, A-014, Wave 9.10 patterns). This is exemplary governance documentation practice. The LL-MAT-W11-001 and LL-MAT-W11-002 lessons in the continuous improvement table add further institutional memory. Future IAA invocations should verify this pattern is maintained in subsequent wave planning sections.

---

## fail_only_once_updates

No new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rules added this session. The pre-token invocation pattern (learning note 2) is an established resolution, not a new breach pattern. Observation recorded in learning_notes for future reference.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

Concrete improvement suggestion: The AAWP_MAT category overlay (OVL-AM-001 through OVL-AM-003) does not include an explicit check for "cross-wave learning outcomes present in planning artifact for waves that resolved prior governance incidents." The Wave 11 §2.12 correctly included INC-IAA-SKIP-001 and A-014 references — but this was foreman initiative, not a required check. A new overlay check **OVL-AM-004: Prior governance incident learning outcomes explicitly referenced in wave planning section** would formally require future wave planning sections to document applicable FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rules and incident resolutions. This would make INC-IAA-SKIP-001 coverage mandatory for Wave 11 and beyond, rather than optional. Recommend adding OVL-AM-004 to iaa-category-overlays.md in a future CS2-authorized governance update.
