## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Learning Applied

**A-001 (IAA invocation evidence in PR artifacts)**:
Evidence: PR was opened without IAA invocation. No ASSURANCE-TOKEN, no advisory reference, no IAA evidence in original PR bundle. Retroactive invocation triggered by CS2 stop-and-fix feedback.
Outcome: FAIL ❌ — Process violation confirmed. IAA was not invoked before PR was opened.

**A-002 (IAA mandatory regardless of task origin)**:
Evidence: 17 `.github/agents/*.md` files modified. Category is AGENT_CONTRACT. IAA is mandatory per A-001.
Outcome: FAIL ❌ — IAA was not invoked. Task origin (compliance mandate) does not exempt from IAA invocation requirement.

**A-003 (Ambiguity resolves to mandatory invocation)**:
Evidence: No ambiguity — category is AGENT_CONTRACT.
Outcome: PASS ✅ — Unambiguous. Mandatory invocation was required.
