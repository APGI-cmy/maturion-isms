## Specific Fix Verification (session-027 F-001)

**F-001a — Instance 1** (CL-2-D1 §4 Schema Summary table, org_page_chunks row):
- Was: `⚠️ CL-5 scope TBD — CS2 to decide`
- Now (line 244): `⚠️ CL-5 scope: CS2 decision required`
- Verification: grep confirmed. TBD scan: ZERO matches on CL-2-D1. ✅ FIXED

**F-001b — Instance 2** (CL-2-D2 §8 Consolidated Mapping Table, criteria_chunks row):
- Was: `❌ TBD`
- Now (line 177): `❌ PENDING — deprecated table; live query required`
- Verification: grep confirmed. TBD scan: ZERO matches on CL-2-D2. ✅ FIXED

## Advisory (non-blocking — carried from session-027 ADV-001)

ADV-001: Live row counts for all 4 legacy tables remain PENDING — no live DB access at authoring time. SQL queries documented in CL-2-D1 §5 (Q1–Q7). CS2 must run these before CP-2 sign-off and before CL-5 entry. NOT a blocking IAA finding.

| A-017 | N/A | PENDING token |

**fail_only_once_updates**: NONE this session — no new governance failure patterns observed. All existing rules functioned as intended. The re-invocation protocol (PENDING → live invocation → ASSURANCE-TOKEN → foreman fills verbatim section) worked cleanly as designed.

---

## Learning Notes

1. **Clean re-invocation protocol execution**: This session is the first clean single-pass re-invocation following a session-027 REJECTION-PACKAGE where ALL corrective actions were taken correctly. The foreman: (a) created PREHANDOVER proof with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`, (b) created session memory, (c) invoked IAA via the tool. All three session-027 failures resolved in a single corrective cycle. This demonstrates that when the root cause is correctly identified (single missing artifact), the fix is clean and complete.

2. **PREHANDOVER ceremony design validation**: The two-phase ceremony (PENDING → IAA invocation → ASSURANCE-TOKEN → foreman fills verbatim section) functions correctly. The CORE-016 check correctly handles the PENDING state as a live invocation, not a fabrication. The A-006 detection (INC-IAA-SKIP-001) correctly passes for PENDING tokens (as opposed to bare PHASE_A_ADVISORY date strings). No ambiguity in the protocol at this point.

3. **Content quality persistence**: The governance-liaison-isms deliverable (782 lines, 41KB, 11/12 AC met) remained unchanged from session-027 — the REJECTION-PACKAGE correctly blocked only on ceremony, not content. The ASSURANCE-TOKEN now reflects both process compliance (ceremony) and content quality (specification). This validates the governance model: ceremony guards process integrity; content quality is assessed by the QP (Foreman); IAA verifies both.

4. **Session-027 learning applied**: The session-027 learning note #3 ("PREHANDOVER proof should be created at wave planning time before liaison delivery begins") was apparently not implemented retroactively (PREHANDOVER was created post-delivery), but the corrective cycle was efficient — single re-invocation with clean ASSURANCE-TOKEN. The cycle cost was one additional IAA session. Future waves should apply the session-027 improvement suggestion to avoid this overhead.

5. **Governance-liaison phase mis-declaration**: The PREHANDOVER proof correctly notes that "governance-liaison session-029 incorrectly cited PHASE_A_ADVISORY; the correct phase is PHASE_B_BLOCKING and this PREHANDOVER proof supersedes that incorrect advisory." The Foreman correctly overrode the liaison's self-assessment. The A-018 candidate (agents must not declare IAA adoption phase) from session-027 learning remains a candidate but has not recurred in a new agent this session — not yet elevated to a new rule.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **PREHANDOVER proof pre-creation standard**: The single-most impactful governance process improvement for AAWP_MAT waves is creating the PREHANDOVER proof at wave START (before delegating to builders/liaisons), not at wave END. This transforms ceremony from a post-delivery gate-blocker into a live tracking document. Recommend adding this as an explicit step in the foreman Phase 3 POLC-Orchestration checklist: "Before delegating to any agent: create PREHANDOVER proof with iaa_audit_token: PENDING and commit to branch."

2. **FAIL-ONLY-ONCE file integrity**: The FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md file has duplicate rule numbers (A-004 appears twice with different content; A-016 appears twice with different content). This is a file integrity issue — while the substantive rules are all present, the duplicate IDs could cause confusion in future sessions. Recommend CS2 authorize a cleanup pass to renumber the duplicates (A-004b → A-018 pattern).

## Fail-Only-Once Updates

NO NEW RULES added this session. The fixes applied were exactly as specified in session-027. The remediation protocol (STOP-AND-FIX → targeted fix → re-invocation) worked correctly. No new governance failure patterns observed.

Gap noted: The FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md has two rules carrying ID A-016 (cross-PR token reuse and trigger table misapplication). Renumbering still pending — first noted in session-027 L-003. Non-blocking.

---

## Prior Sessions: Open REJECTION-PACKAGE Tracking

- session-027 REJECTION-PACKAGE for Wave CL-2 → **RESOLVED** by this session-028 ASSURANCE-TOKEN ✅

---

## Learning Notes

**L-001 (inherited from session-027)** — TBD-to-PENDING conversion was correctly applied by the Foreman in both instances. The fix protocol (targeted find-and-replace using exact session-027 F-001 citations) was efficient. No over-correction, no new issues introduced. The STOP-AND-FIX mechanism functioned as designed.

**L-002** — Re-invocations after targeted REJECTION-PACKAGEs (single-failure fixes) consistently pass quickly when the Foreman applies the exact fix stated in the failure description. IAA should continue providing maximally specific fix instructions (line numbers + exact before/after text) to enable efficient remediation. This was confirmed effective across session pairs: 024→025→026 and 027→028.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

**S-001 (inherited from session-027)**: The foreman and builder FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registries should explicitly prohibit "TBD" in table cells, mandating "PENDING — [reason]" instead. This has now been confirmed as a fully-preventable failure type.

**S-002 (new)**: For LKIAC-type waves that produce governance documents without live DB access, the PREHANDOVER proof should include a pre-completed "Advisory Items" section acknowledging that live row counts are pending CS2 action. This would allow IAA to formally note the advisory at time of initial invocation without it looking like an incomplete deliverable. Reduces the ADV-001 pattern recurring across future LKIAC waves.
