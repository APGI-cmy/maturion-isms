## Specific Fix Verification (session-027 F-001)

**F-001a — Instance 1** (CL-2-D1 §4 Schema Summary table, org_page_chunks row):
- Was: `⚠️ CL-5 scope TBD — CS2 to decide`
- Now (line 244): `⚠️ CL-5 scope: CS2 decision required`
- Verification: grep confirmed. TBD scan: ZERO matches on CL-2-D1. ✅ FIXED

**F-001b — Instance 2** (CL-2-D2 §8 Consolidated Mapping Table, criteria_chunks row):
- Was: `❌ TBD`
- Now (line 177): `❌ PENDING — deprecated table; live query required`
- Verification: grep confirmed. TBD scan: ZERO matches on CL-2-D2. ✅ FIXED

---

## Verdict

- verdict: ASSURANCE-TOKEN
- token_reference: IAA-session-028-20260301-PASS
- merge_gate_parity_result: PASS (all 3 checks PASS)
- adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict: PHASE_B_BLOCKING

---

## Advisory (non-blocking — carried from session-027 ADV-001)

ADV-001: Live row counts for all 4 legacy tables remain PENDING — no live DB access at authoring time. SQL queries documented in CL-2-D1 §5 (Q1–Q7). CS2 must run these before CP-2 sign-off and before CL-5 entry. NOT a blocking IAA finding.

---

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

| Rule | Applied | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| A-001 (IAA invocation evidence must be present) | YES | PASS — PREHANDOVER proof present with iaa_audit_token: PENDING |
| A-002 (no class exceptions) | YES | PASS — no exemption claimed |
| A-006 (PHASE_A_ADVISORY FABRICATION detection) | YES | PASS — iaa_audit_token: PENDING (not a bare date string) |
| A-016 (cross-PR token reuse) | YES (N/A) | PASS — token PENDING; no cross-PR reuse possible |
| A-017 (REJECTION-as-PASS citation) | YES (N/A) | PASS — no PASS token cited |
| A-015 (Tier 2 knowledge patch requires PREHANDOVER) | N/A | Not a Tier 2 patch |

---

## Fail-Only-Once Updates

NO NEW RULES added this session. The fixes applied were exactly as specified in session-027. The remediation protocol (STOP-AND-FIX → targeted fix → re-invocation) worked correctly. No new governance failure patterns observed.

Gap noted: The FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md has two rules carrying ID A-016 (cross-PR token reuse and trigger table misapplication). Renumbering still pending — first noted in session-027 L-003. Non-blocking.

---

## Prior Sessions: Open REJECTION-PACKAGE Tracking

- session-027 REJECTION-PACKAGE for Wave CL-2 → **RESOLVED** by this session-028 ASSURANCE-TOKEN ✅

---

## Learning Notes

**L-001 (inherited from session-027)** — TBD-to-PENDING conversion was correctly applied by the Foreman in both instances. The fix protocol (targeted find-and-replace using exact session-027 F-001 citations) was efficient. No over-correction, no new issues introduced. The STOP-AND-FIX mechanism functioned as designed.

**L-002** — Re-invocations after targeted REJECTION-PACKAGEs (single-failure fixes) consistently pass quickly when the Foreman applies the exact fix stated in the failure description. IAA should continue providing maximally specific fix instructions (line numbers + exact before/after text) to enable efficient remediation. This was confirmed effective across session pairs: 024→025→026 and 027→028.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

**S-001 (inherited from session-027)**: The foreman and builder FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registries should explicitly prohibit "TBD" in table cells, mandating "PENDING — [reason]" instead. This has now been confirmed as a fully-preventable failure type.

**S-002 (new)**: For LKIAC-type waves that produce governance documents without live DB access, the PREHANDOVER proof should include a pre-completed "Advisory Items" section acknowledging that live row counts are pending CS2 action. This would allow IAA to formally note the advisory at time of initial invocation without it looking like an incomplete deliverable. Reduces the ADV-001 pattern recurring across future LKIAC waves.
