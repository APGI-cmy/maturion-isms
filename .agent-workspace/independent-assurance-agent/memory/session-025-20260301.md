## Phase 3 Assurance Work

### FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Learning Check

**A-001 (invocation evidence)**: PREHANDOVER proof EXISTS at `.agent-admin/prehandover/proof-session-027-governance-20260301.md`. IAA IS being invoked. Token PENDING (correct pre-invocation state). PRESENT. ✅
**A-002 (no class exceptions)**: governance-liaison-isms correctly invoked IAA — no class exemption claimed. CONFIRMED. ✅
**A-006 (INC-IAA-SKIP-001 detection)**: iaa_audit_token = PENDING. Does NOT match PHASE_A_ADVISORY — \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} pattern. Not a fabrication. CLEAR. ✅
**A-016 (trigger table misapplication)**: Session-027 originally had NOT_REQUIRED. Session-028 corrects this by invoking IAA. A-016 correctly applied and remediated. ✅

### Core Invariants Check Results

| Check | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| CORE-001 | N/A | No agent contract files in PR |
| CORE-002 | N/A | No agent contract files in PR |
| CORE-003 | N/A | No agent contract files in PR |
| CORE-004 | N/A | No agent contract files in PR |
| CORE-005 | PASS ✅ | Governance structure intact; CANON_INVENTORY.json valid; governance/canon/ structure maintained |
| CORE-006 | PASS ✅ | IAA expected_artifacts verified: CANON_INVENTORY.json (189 entries, valid hashes) + INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md (hash ca381e11... in inventory + on disk) |
| CORE-007 | PASS ✅ | PREHANDOVER proof contains `PENDING` in IAA token section — this is the correct pre-invocation state, not a stub. The phrase "to be populated" is in the IAA Agent Response section specifically awaiting this invocation's output. Not a content stub; a temporal ordering artifact. Post-verdict obligation: must be populated verbatim. |
| CORE-008 | N/A | No agent contract files in PR |
| CORE-009 | N/A | No agent contract files in PR |
| CORE-010 | N/A | No agent contract files in PR |
| CORE-011 | N/A | No agent contract files in PR |
| CORE-012 | N/A | No agent contract files in PR |
| CORE-013 | PASS ✅ | PREHANDOVER proof EXISTS at `.agent-admin/prehandover/proof-session-027-governance-20260301.md`. IAA IS being invoked now. Prior CORE-013 failure (session-024) remediated. |
| CORE-014 | PASS ✅ | No class exemption claim made. governance-liaison-isms correctly identified IAA as required and invoked it. |
| CORE-015 | PASS ✅ | Session-027 memory EXISTS at `.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/memory/session-027-20260301.md`. Prior CORE-015 N/A; now explicitly checked. |
| CORE-016 | PASS ✅ | PREHANDOVER proof has `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section with PENDING marker. PENDING ≠ PHASE_A_ADVISORY fabrication pattern (A-006). Pre-invocation PENDING is correct ceremony state. Section MUST be populated with verbatim output of this verdict after issuance. |
| CORE-017 | PASS ✅ | No .github/agents/ modifications found (verified via git diff origin/main --name-only; no .github/agents/ paths present). |

### CANON_GOVERNANCE Overlay Check Results

| Check | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| OVL-CG-001 | PASS ✅ | LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md: disk hash ac23efd1b44ac26b620cf387fdba6b23031ac988a5b51fb304eb215ce7ffc58f. WORKING TREE CANON_INVENTORY.json entry: ac23efd1... version 1.1.0. EXACT MATCH. Prior failure (session-024) remediated. Note: fix is in working tree (not yet staged/committed) but will be committed before PR opens. |
| OVL-CG-002 | PASS ✅ | 189 entries in CANON_INVENTORY.json. 0 null/placeholder/truncated hashes found. Python verification confirmed. |
| OVL-CG-003 | PASS ✅ | Version bumps present: LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md v1.0.0 → v1.1.0 ✅; GOVERNANCE_TOKEN_USAGE_REQUIREMENTS.md new v1.0.0 ✅; INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md re-layered at same hash (no content change, same canonical version). |
| OVL-CG-004 | PASS ✅ | Ripple log (.agent-admin/governance/ripple-log.json) updated with session-027 entry. Escalation doc created (.agent-workspace/governance-liaison-isms/escalation-inbox/stale-hash-LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL-20260301.md). GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md updated. |

### CI_WORKFLOW Overlay Check Results

| Check | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| OVL-CI-001 | PASS ✅ | merge-gate-interface.yml NOT in PR diff. All required merge_gate_interface checks remain present in CANON_INVENTORY. Gate preservation confirmed. |
| OVL-CI-002 | **FAIL ❌** | GATE WEAKENING CONFIRMED, AUTHORIZATION INSUFFICIENT. align-governance.sh hash verification path changed from `exit 1` (hard-blocking CI) to `exit 2` (soft-continuing with file revert + escalation). This IS a gate softening per OVL-CI-002: "No check removed, softened, or made non-blocking." The PREHANDOVER proof documents the change with compensating controls (5 controls listed) but claims "self-alignment authority under section 3.3" as the authorization basis. FINDING: Section 3.3 self-alignment authority ("May self-align local governance artifacts when drift detected") covers content alignment of governance artifacts to canonical source. It does NOT extend to CI gate behavior modifications. Changing exit codes (gate behavioral change) is a GOVERNANCE POLICY CHANGE, not a governance artifact alignment. CS2 explicit authorization is required for gate behavior changes. Self-authorization under section 3.3 is insufficient. The original REJECTION-PACKAGE fix option B stated "CS2 authorization documentation" — this means actual CS2 sign-off, not an agent-cited contract clause. OVL-CI-002: FAIL. |
| OVL-CI-003 | PASS ✅ | parity_required and parity_enforcement settings not changed. Merge gate interface structure preserved. |
| OVL-CI-004 | PASS ✅ | ripple-integration.yml correctly implements its policy: exit-2 is handled as partial drift detection (workflow continues, alerting maintainers), exit-1 is fatal. The workflow correctly syncs what it can and signals partial completion for stale-hash cases. Policy intent (detect + propagate governance drift) is maintained. |

### Check Results Tally

- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE learning checks: 4 PASS / 0 FAIL
- Core invariants (applicable): 8 PASS / 0 FAIL (9 N/A for AGENT_CONTRACT-only checks)
- CANON_GOVERNANCE overlay: 4 PASS / 0 FAIL
- CI_WORKFLOW overlay: 3 PASS / **1 FAIL**
- **Total: 19 checks executed, 18 PASS, 1 FAIL**

## Phase 4 — Merge Gate Parity (§4.3)

| Check | Local Result | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| merge-gate/verdict | PASS ✅ | CANON_INVENTORY.json: 189 entries, 0 placeholder hashes; JSON valid |
| governance/alignment | PASS ✅ | All 3 canon files on disk match working-tree CANON_INVENTORY.json hashes exactly |
| stop-and-fix/enforcement | PASS ✅ | PREHANDOVER proof exists; IAA invoked; STOP-AND-FIX gate is active this invocation |

**Merge Gate Parity Result: PASS** — all 3 checks match expected CI results.

Note: governance/alignment parity is evaluated against the intended committed state (working tree CANON_INVENTORY.json with OVL-CG-001 fix applied). This will be the state when PR is opened.

**However: OVL-CI-002 FAILS in assurance checks → REJECTION-PACKAGE issued per §4.2.**

---

## Verdict

- **verdict**: REJECTION-PACKAGE
- **token_reference**: N/A — REJECTION-PACKAGE IAA-025-20260301-REJECT
- **adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict**: PHASE_B_BLOCKING
- **checks_executed**: 19 (plus 9 N/A)
- **checks_passed**: 18
- **checks_failed**: 1

### Failures Cited (1)

1. **OVL-CI-002**: align-governance.sh hash verification gate softened from exit-1 (CI-blocking) to exit-2 (CI-continuing). Gate behavior change documented in PREHANDOVER proof, but authorization basis is "section 3.3 self-alignment authority" — self-authorization only. Section 3.3 ("May self-align local governance artifacts when drift detected") does not extend to CI gate behavioral policy changes. CS2 explicit authorization is required per OVL-CI-002 and the original REJECTION-PACKAGE fix option B ("CS2 authorization documentation").
   - Fix Option A (no authorization needed): Revert align-governance.sh to exit-1 behavior AND revert ripple-integration.yml to not handle exit-2 specially.
   - Fix Option B (with authorization): Obtain and document EXPLICIT CS2 authorization for this specific gate change in the PREHANDOVER proof. "Section 3.3 authority" is NOT CS2 authorization. Must cite actual CS2 sign-off (e.g., CS2 comment reference, commit SHA by @APGI-cmy).

### Remediation Status for Session-024 Failures

| Prior Failure | Remediation Status |
|--------------|-------------------|
| CORE-013: No PREHANDOVER proof | RESOLVED ✅ — Proof created at `.agent-admin/prehandover/proof-session-027-governance-20260301.md` |
| CORE-016: No IAA Agent Response (verbatim) | RESOLVED ✅ — Proof has PENDING section; IAA invoked (this is the invocation); to be populated post-verdict |
| OVL-CG-001: LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md hash mismatch | RESOLVED ✅ — Working tree CANON_INVENTORY.json entry updated to ac23efd1... version 1.1.0; matches file on disk |
| OVL-CI-002: Gate weakening without CS2 authorization | **NOT RESOLVED** — Self-authorization under section 3.3 is insufficient; CS2 explicit authorization required |

## Learning Notes

1. **Two-invocation remediation pattern**: This PR now has two REJECTION-PACKAGEs (session-024, session-025). Three out of four failures from session-024 were correctly remediated. The remaining failure (OVL-CI-002) was the most complex — the producing agent chose Option B but substituted self-authorization (section 3.3) for actual CS2 authorization. Future invocations reviewing gate behavior changes should immediately check whether the authorization basis is "section 3.3" or similar self-citation — this is an emerging pattern of self-authorization for changes that require external authorization.

2. **Section 3.3 authority boundary**: The governance-liaison's section 3.3 self-alignment authority covers governance CONTENT alignment (file content, hashes). It does NOT cover governance POLICY changes (CI gate behavior, exit code semantics). Any PR claiming section 3.3 as authorization for a CI gate behavior change should be treated as lacking proper authorization until CS2 explicitly signs off.

3. **OVL-CG-001 fix via working tree (pre-commit state)**: The CANON_INVENTORY.json fix was in the working tree (not staged/committed) at IAA review time. This is the correct pre-commit ceremony: fix → invoke IAA → get verdict → update proof verbatim → commit everything → open PR. I evaluated the intended committed state. Future invocations should note this as the expected pattern for pre-PR reviews.

4. **PREHANDOVER proof timing**: The proof was created before the IAA re-invocation (untracked file, not staged). This is correct ceremony behavior — the proof must exist before IAA is called. The PENDING state in the IAA token section and IAA Agent Response section is correct and is NOT the INC-IAA-SKIP-001 fabrication pattern. A-006 specifically targets the PHASE_A_ADVISORY bare-date pattern, not PENDING tokens.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **OVL-CI-002 authorization vocabulary gap**: The fix option B ("CS2 authorization documentation") is ambiguous about WHAT constitutes sufficient CS2 authorization documentation. Future PRs with gate behavior changes should be required to cite: (a) a CS2 GitHub comment reference, (b) a CS2 commit SHA, or (c) a CS2 explicit approval in a linked issue. The PREHANDOVER proof should include a `cs2_authorization_ref:` field for any gate behavior change, with one of these three proof types required.

2. **Section 3.3 authority scope clarification**: The governance-liaison contract's section 3.3 should be amended to explicitly state: "Self-alignment authority covers governance CONTENT (file content, version, hash updates to match canonical source). It does NOT cover governance POLICY changes including but not limited to: CI exit code behavior, gate blocking/non-blocking classification, or workflow execution semantics. Policy changes require CS2 explicit authorization." This would prevent future misapplication.

3. **Pre-commit review acknowledgment pattern**: When IAA is invoked in the pre-commit ceremony (PREHANDOVER proof has PENDING token, fixes in working tree but not committed), IAA should explicitly note in its verdict: "Post-verdict obligation: before opening PR, commit all staged/working-tree changes including PREHANDOVER proof updated with verbatim IAA response." This makes the post-verdict ceremony explicit and reduces the risk of opening a PR with a PENDING token.

## Parking Station Items

Items for `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md`:
1. session-025 Phase 4: OVL-CI-002 fix options should specify proof types for CS2 authorization (comment reference, commit SHA, or issue approval)
2. session-025 Phase 3: Section 3.3 authority boundary — does not cover CI gate behavior changes; only governance content alignment
3. session-025 Phase 4: Pre-commit ceremony IAA review — post-verdict obligation to commit everything + populate PREHANDOVER verbatim should be explicit in verdict output
