**verdict**: ASSURANCE-TOKEN
**token_reference**: IAA-WAVE6-20260225-PASS
**adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict**: PHASE_A_ADVISORY

## Advisory Findings (non-blocking)

| ID | Finding | Severity |
|----|---------|---------|
| A-F-1 | api-builder session memory uses narrative markdown for preflight attestation ("Read `.github/agents/api-builder.md`. Identity extracted:") rather than the structured YAML block (`phase_1_preflight.agent_file_read: YES`) used by qa-builder in the same wave. Both formats evidence compliance; inconsistency creates minor audit friction. | MINOR — advisory |
| A-F-2 | PREHANDOVER proof iaa_audit_token field is correctly marked PENDING (Foreman left placeholder for IAA to fill). This is correct process flow. Future sessions should confirm this field is updated in the commit bundle after IAA issues its token. | PROCESS NOTE — advisory |

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

**fail_only_once_rules_applied**:

| Rule | Applied | Outcome |
|------|---------|---------|
| A-001: IAA invocation evidence must be present | YES | PASS — PREHANDOVER proof section "IAA Invocation Record" + iaa_audit_token PENDING placeholder both evidence Foreman's Step 4.3a IAA invocation |
| A-002: IAA mandatory for ALL agent contract classes | YES | PASS — Foreman correctly invoked IAA; no exemption claimed; both builder classes included |
| A-003: Ambiguity resolves to mandatory invocation | N/A — category unambiguous (AAWP_MAT) | N/A |

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY — this field may NEVER be blank)

1. **Standardise preflight attestation format across builder classes**: Both builders comply with Phase 1 preflight requirements, but qa-builder uses structured YAML (`phase_1_preflight.agent_file_read: YES`) while api-builder uses prose markdown. The Foreman delegation template (improvement suggested in session-055) should also specify the expected output format for preflight attestation in session memory. Standardising to YAML makes IAA verification deterministic and scriptable.

2. **PREHANDOVER token update ceremony**: The PREHANDOVER proof correctly leaves `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`. A lightweight ceremony should be codified — after IAA issues a token, the Foreman (or an automated script) appends the token reference to the PREHANDOVER proof before the PR is opened. This closes the loop on the artifact bundle integrity.

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Updates

**fail_only_once_updates**: none this session — no recurring pattern identified. Session-001 advisory A-F-2 (inaccurate model name in PREHANDOVER) did not recur. Session-001 advisory A-F-1 (commit bundling) did not recur (Wave 6 commit is a clean single-purpose commit: `feat(ai-centre): Wave 6 — AnthropicAdapter, OpenAI image-gen, course-crafter-advisor persona`). No new rule warranted at this time.

---

## Learning Notes

1. **Preflight format divergence is a pattern to watch**: qa-builder (remediation session) used explicit YAML; api-builder (direct delegation) used prose. This is session-002's first observation of this divergence. If it recurs in session-003, add a FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule requiring YAML format.
2. **QP-FAIL-then-remediation cycle works correctly**: Foreman correctly caught qa-builder's missing preflight in the first delivery, issued QP FAIL, re-delegated with explicit requirement, and accepted only after evidence was produced. This is the correct POLC control loop working as designed. IAA's independent verification confirms the loop closed correctly.
3. **Single-commit wave bundles are cleaner**: The Wave 6 commit bundles all 7 artifact files in one purposeful commit (`feat(ai-centre):`). This is an improvement over the session-001 observation (A-F-2: Wave 5 mixed governance + builder artifacts). Positive pattern — reinforce.
4. **copilot-swe-agent as builder implementation vehicle**: The git commit is authored by `copilot-swe-agent[bot]` co-authored by CS2. This is the correct pattern — IAA treats copilot-swe-agent as the builder implementation vehicle, with Foreman providing orchestration oversight and CS2 as ultimate authority. POLC boundary holds.
