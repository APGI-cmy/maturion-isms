## Invocation Context

- pr_reviewed: Wave AIMC-AUDIT-P1 — Comprehensive AIMC Test & Improvement Plan (Session 073, Branch: copilot/compile-auditing-plan-foreman)
- invoking_agent: foreman-v2-agent v6.2.0
- producing_agent: foreman-v2-agent v6.2.0
- producing_agent_class: foreman
- independence_check: CONFIRMED — IAA did NOT produce any artifact in this PR
- artifact_description: Governance planning document (AIMC Phase 1 Comprehensive Test & Improvement Plan) + Foreman session memory + PREHANDOVER proof + parking station entry

---

## Phase 2 — Alignment

**pr_category**: AAWP_MAT (governance audit planning document — wave-coordination artifact produced by Foreman within POLC remit; Foreman correctly invoked IAA per A-014; ambiguity rule applied conservatively to include)

**iaa_triggered**: YES — Foreman correctly invoked IAA per A-014 before writing iaa_audit_token

**foreman_mandate_check**: APPLICABLE — Foreman-class agent produced the work; mandatory invocation applies per A-002

**ambiguity_check**: CLEAR — Foreman explicitly invoked IAA (A-014 compliance); no exemption claimed

**overlays_loaded**:
- Core invariants checklist: 15 checks (CORE-001 through CORE-015)
- AAWP_MAT overlay: OVL-AM-001, OVL-AM-002, OVL-AM-003

---

## Phase 3 — Assurance Work

### FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Learning Checks

**A-001 (invocation evidence)**:
Evidence: PREHANDOVER proof has `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` — IAA IS being invoked now (this is the invocation). Session memory confirms `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`. Correct pre-token state.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**A-002 (no class exemption)**:
Evidence: Foreman correctly invoked IAA. No exemption claimed. A-014 demonstrates operationalised compliance.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**A-003 (ambiguity resolves mandatory)**:
Evidence: No ambiguity — Foreman proactively invoked IAA.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**A-004 (bootstrap directive)**:
Evidence: agent-bootstrap called as absolute first action this session.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**A-005 (no .github/agents/ modification)**:
Evidence: git status confirms no .github/agents/ files in modified/untracked set.
Verdict: PASS ✅

### Core Invariants

**CORE-001 through CORE-012**: AGENT_CONTRACT specific. Not applicable — no .github/agents/ files changed. N/A (justified: not an agent contract PR).

**CORE-005 (governance block present)**: N/A — governance block is for agent contracts, not planning documents. Document has proper metadata header (Version, Authority, Date, Produced By, Status).

**CORE-006 (CANON_INVENTORY alignment)**: PASS ✅ — governance/AUDIT/ is not a canon directory. CANON_INVENTORY not required to list audit planning documents. Existing CANON_INVENTORY verified (188 canons, 0 bad hashes).

**CORE-007 (no placeholder content)**:
Evidence: grep scan found "TBD" in §4.8 Effectiveness Metrics baseline column only — these are correctly documented unknown production baselines (M-002, M-003, M-006, M-007, M-008) to be measured during audit execution. This is expected and appropriate use of TBD in a planning document baseline column. No structural stubs or TODO flags in document body.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-013 (IAA invocation evidence)**:
Evidence: PREHANDOVER proof present at declared path with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`. This session IS the invocation referenced.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-014 (no class exemption)**:
Evidence: No exemption claimed by invoking agent.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**CORE-015 (session memory present)**:
Evidence: `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-073-wave-aimc-audit-p1-20260228.md` present and populated with all required fields.
Verdict: PASS ✅

### AAWP_MAT Category Overlay

**OVL-AM-001 (stub population complete)**:
Evidence: Document is 40,975 bytes, comprehensive, 10+ sections, 70+ test IDs, all with descriptions, assigned agents, and evidence requirements. No structural stubs. §10 acceptance criteria: 9/10 checked (10th = CS2 review — correctly pending).
Verdict: PASS ✅

**OVL-AM-002 (evidence artifacts present)**:
Evidence: Full bundle present — (1) AIMC_PHASE1_AUDIT_AND_TEST_PLAN.md ✅, (2) session-073 memory ✅, (3) PREHANDOVER-session-073 ✅, (4) parking station entry appended ✅.
Verdict: PASS ✅

**OVL-AM-003 (governance alignment)**:
Evidence: Document references AIMC_STRATEGY.md v1.0.0, correct persona files, correct migration numbers, correct test baseline (425 tests, 100% GREEN per session-071). Gap analysis consistent with Wave 9 audit findings. Agent assignments align with declared agent capabilities.
Verdict: PASS ✅

### POLC Boundary Checks

**No production code written by Foreman**:
Evidence: git status shows only governance/AUDIT/ doc, agent-workspace files, parking station. No apps/, modules/, packages/, api/ files modified.
Verdict: PASS ✅

### Check Tally

- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE learning checks: 5 PASS / 0 FAIL
- Core invariants (applicable): 5 PASS / 0 FAIL (7 N/A — AGENT_CONTRACT specific)
- AAWP_MAT overlay: 3 PASS / 0 FAIL
- POLC boundary: 1 PASS / 0 FAIL
- **Total: 14 checks, 14 PASS, 0 FAIL**

## Phase 4 — Merge Gate Parity (§4.3)

**Local equivalent checks for governance-only PR:**

1. YAML validation — No YAML files changed. N/A (not applicable).
2. Character count — 40,975 bytes. Within limits. PASS ✅
3. Checklist compliance — §10: 9/10 items checked; 10th (CS2 authorisation) pending, correctly. PASS ✅
4. Canon hash verification — 188 canons, 0 bad hashes. PASS ✅
5. No .github/agents/ files — CONFIRMED. PASS ✅
6. No .github/workflows/ files — CONFIRMED. PASS ✅
7. No production code changes — CONFIRMED. PASS ✅
8. governance/alignment — Document aligned with current canon. PASS ✅
9. stop-and-fix/enforcement — No open REJECTION-PACKAGEs. PASS ✅
10. merge-gate/verdict — All local checks pass. PASS ✅

**merge_gate_parity_result**: PASS

## Suggestions for Improvement

No degradation observed. Continuous improvement note: The Foreman's inclusion of a §10 Acceptance Criteria checklist within the governance planning document itself is a strong practice that significantly accelerates IAA verification. Recommend formalising this pattern in the PREHANDOVER template guidance — governance planning documents (audit plans, wave plans, AAWP updates) should all include a self-contained §Acceptance Criteria section with checklist items so IAA can verify completeness in a single scan rather than synthesising scattered sections. This should be added as PS-IAA-006 to the parking station.

## Parking Station Entry

Appended to `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md`:
`| 2026-02-28 | independent-assurance-agent | session-018 | [PHASE-4] | Governance planning documents should include a self-contained acceptance criteria checklist section to accelerate IAA verification | session-018-20260228.md |`

---

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Updates

**fail_only_once_updates**: NONE this session — no new recurring patterns identified. All 5 active rules continue to perform correctly. A-014 operationalisation confirmed working (Foreman invoked IAA before writing token — PASS).
