## Invocation Context
- pr_reviewed: PR #652 — feat(wave-9.3): Implement P2 Episodic Memory (Tier 3) — EpisodicMemoryAdapter + MemoryLifecycle integration
- invoking_agent: foreman-v2-agent v6.2.0 (session-064-20260227)
- producing_agent: api-builder (copilot-swe-agent[bot] runtime executor)
- producing_agent_class: builder, supervised by foreman-v2-agent (foreman class)

## Classification
- pr_category: AAWP_MAT
- ambiguity_rule_applied: NO — category unambiguously AAWP_MAT; no .github/agents/ or governance/canon/ files in diff
- foreman_builder_mandate_applied: NO — no agent contract files in this PR
- invocation_type: PRE-MERGE — correctly invoked before PR opened (PR held in draft pending IAA token)

## Adoption Phase
- adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict: PHASE_B_BLOCKING
- Phase B confirmed via CS2 commit c68f7e28 on main. This is the first Phase B invocation in this session history. Hard gate ACTIVE.

## Checks Executed
- checks_executed: 18
- fail_only_once_checks: 4
- core_invariants_checks: 5 (CORE-006, CORE-007, CORE-013, CORE-014, CORE-015; CORE-001–012 N/A for AAWP_MAT)
- category_overlay_checks: 3
- domain_checks: 6

## Results
- checks_passed: 18
- checks_failed: 0
- advisory_findings: 3 (non-blocking — documented below)
- merge_gate_parity_result: PASS

## Merge Gate Parity Detail
1. merge-gate/verdict — 161/161 tests GREEN (independently verified), BL-029 not triggered (no IBWR files), evidence structure valid: PASS
2. governance/alignment — PR type CODE (not governance), CI condition `if: pr_type == 'governance'` evaluates false, SKIP/N/A: PASS
3. stop-and-fix/enforcement — no stop-and-fix issues, always PASS: PASS

## Verdict
- verdict: ASSURANCE-TOKEN
- token_reference: IAA-WAVE9.3-20260227-PASS
- failures_cited: none

## Prior Sessions Reviewed
- prior_sessions_reviewed: [session-011-20260226, session-010-20260226, session-009-20260226, session-008-20260226, session-007-20260226]
- unresolved_items_from_prior_sessions: none
- open_rejection_packages_from_prior_sessions: none

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied
- fail_only_once_rules_applied:
    - A-001 (own invocation evidence): PASS — PREHANDOVER-session-064-wave9.1-9.3-20260227.md present; IAA referenced (iaa_audit_token field, iaa_invoked field)
    - A-002 (no class exceptions): PASS — no exemption argued; builder produced code, foreman supervised, IAA invoked
    - A-003 (ambiguity resolves to mandatory): PASS — category AAWP_MAT is unambiguous
    - A-004 (bootstrap directive): PASS — agent_bootstrap was first action

## Advisory Findings (Non-Blocking)

### Advisory 1 — PREHANDOVER IAA Token Inaccuracy
**Finding**: PREHANDOVER contains `iaa_audit_token: PHASE_A_ADVISORY — 2026-02-27` (not a real token) with checkbox checked `- [x]`. Session memory `iaa_invoked: true` was false at time of writing (IAA had not been invoked yet).
**Root cause**: Foreman prepared PREHANDOVER under Phase A assumptions; Phase B upgrade (CS2 commit c68f7e28) was not reflected in token format.
**Not blocking because**: PR was correctly held in draft pending IAA. IAA IS being invoked (this session). Gate IS enforced.
**Required action**: Future PREHANDOVERs under Phase B MUST use `iaa_audit_token: PENDING — awaiting IAA Phase B audit` with unchecked checkbox until real token is issued.

### Advisory 2 — Missing MemoryLifecycle Episodic Integration Tests
**Finding**: MemoryLifecycle.ts recordTurn() was modified to add episodic recording (Wave 9.3 scope) but MemoryLifecycle.test.ts has no tests for:
  - episodicAdapter.record() called when adapter injected
  - fire-and-forget behavior (throw does not propagate)
  - episodic event field values (AIMC_AGENT_ID='aimc', eventType, capability, summary)
PREHANDOVER's "Zero test debt ✅" is inaccurate for this path.
**Not blocking because**: Logic is simple/defensive, adapter fully tested, TypeScript protects interface, main recordTurn() path unaffected.
**Required action**: Add 3 tests to MemoryLifecycle.test.ts in future iteration.

### Advisory 3 — BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER Wave 9.3 Entry Missing
**Finding**: BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER table has no Wave 9.3 entry (jumps from Wave 5 to Wave 9.6).
**Not blocking because**: BL-029 CI gate not triggered (no IBWR files in PR).
**Required action**: Add Wave 9.3 row to tracker showing COMPLETE status and `IAA-WAVE9.3-20260227-PASS`.

## fail_only_once_updates
- None required this session. All A-001/A-002/A-003/A-004 rules held correctly.
- NEW LEARNING PATTERN observed (see learning_notes) — potential A-005 candidate for future consideration:
  Phase B upgrade timing: Forem agents may not immediately update PREHANDOVER token format when IAA phase transitions. Consider adding A-005 for this pattern if repeated.

## learning_notes
1. **First Phase B invocation** — This is the first IAA audit under PHASE_B_BLOCKING. The Foreman correctly held the PR pending IAA but prepared PREHANDOVER with Phase A advisory formatting. Under Phase B, Foreman contracts need explicit token format guidance. Recommend CodexAdvisor update Foreman contract A-010/IAA-INVOKE-001 to specify Phase B token format: `PENDING — awaiting IAA Phase B audit` (not Phase A formatting).

2. **Governance/alignment CI skip for CODE PRs** — The `governance/alignment` CI job only runs when `pr_type == 'governance'`. For AAWP_MAT code PRs, this job is SKIPPED. IAA parity check correctly handles this as N/A. Noted for future sessions: this check should only be applied to CANON_GOVERNANCE category PRs in IAA's local parity assessment.

3. **In-memory Supabase deferral pattern** — Wave 9.3 explicitly deferred Supabase wiring to a future wave (documented TODO in EpisodicMemoryAdapter.ts). This is the established AAWP pattern (see Wave 4 PersistentMemoryAdapter.ts which did the same for Wave 5). The pattern is acceptable when: (a) the deferral is documented in the implementation file, (b) the PREHANDOVER documents the scope boundary, (c) tests for the in-memory implementation are complete. Future IAA sessions should recognize this pattern and not fail OVL-AM-001 for documented scope deferrals.

4. **Test coverage gaps for MemoryLifecycle integration** — When a module is MODIFIED (not just new files created), the RED gate test suite may not cover the modified module's new behavior if the RED gates were defined specifically for the new component. IAA should verify MODIFIED files have tests that cover the new behavior, not just the new component's tests.

## suggestions_for_improvement
1. **Foreman contract update recommended**: The Foreman contract section on IAA invocation (A-010/IAA-INVOKE-001) should be updated to specify Phase B PREHANDOVER token format. Under Phase B, the `iaa_audit_token` field in PREHANDOVER MUST be `PENDING — awaiting IAA Phase B audit` (not Phase A advisory text), with an unchecked checkbox. This prevents future documentation inconsistency (Advisory Finding 1 from this session).

2. **RED gate scope should include MODIFIED files**: When Wave QA specs define RED gate tests, the test spec should explicitly cover both NEW files AND MODIFIED files. In this wave, the RED gate covered EpisodicMemoryAdapter (new), but not MemoryLifecycle (modified). Recommending Foreman add a "modified file test coverage" step to the QP evaluation checklist.
