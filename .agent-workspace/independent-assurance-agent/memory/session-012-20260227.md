# IAA Session Memory — Session 012 — 2026-02-27

## Session Identity
- session_id: session-012-20260227
- date: 2026-02-27
- agent_version: 6.2.0
- contract_version: 2.0.0

## Invocation Context
- pr_reviewed: PR #654 — [MAT Wave 6 Final] FCWT results, QAP gap audit, LDCS seed status, deployment verification, and RCA addendum (branch: copilot/finalize-wave-6-deployment, commit: 2d1f7957ae3f081a067cd572067fe61a0f3f2a24)
- invoking_agent: foreman-v2-agent (session-067-20260227)
- producing_agent: foreman-v2-agent (session-064-20260227)
- producing_agent_class: foreman

## Classification
- pr_category: AAWP_MAT
- ambiguity_rule_applied: NO — category unambiguously AAWP_MAT; no .github/agents/ files in diff; 4 governance-only files changed
- foreman_builder_mandate_applied: NO — no agent contract files in this PR
- invocation_type: PRE-MERGE — correctly invoked before PR open; PR #654 is in draft state; IAA invoked by foreman session-067 at session-012

## Adoption Phase
- adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict: PHASE_B_BLOCKING
- IAA is now in Phase B. This audit is hard-blocking. REJECTION-PACKAGE would prevent PR from being merged.
- Merge authority: CS2 ONLY.

## Checks Executed
- checks_executed: 16
- fail_only_once_checks: 4
- core_invariants_checks: 6 (applicable to AAWP_MAT)
- category_overlay_checks: 3
- merge_gate_parity_checks: 3

## Results
- checks_passed: 16
- checks_failed: 0
- merge_gate_parity_result: PASS

## Merge Gate Parity Detail
All 3 required checks executed locally:
1. Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict — LOCAL: PASS
   - 332 GREEN tests via evidence chain to session-063 (IAA-independently-verified in session-011)
   - 0 MAT-owned failures; 0 new regressions; governance-only commit (4 .md files only)
2. Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment — LOCAL: PASS
   - CANON_INVENTORY 187 canons, 0 bad hashes; IAA canon present; CS2 authorization confirmed
3. Merge Gate Interface / stop-and-fix/enforcement — LOCAL: PASS
   - No open breaches; POLC boundary maintained; bundle complete (4/4 artifacts committed)

## Verdict
- verdict: ASSURANCE-TOKEN
- token_reference: IAA-012-20260227-PASS
- failures_cited: none

## Prior Sessions Reviewed
- prior_sessions_reviewed: [session-011-20260226, session-010-20260226, session-009-20260226, session-008-20260226, session-007-20260226]
- unresolved_items_from_prior_sessions: none
- open_rejection_packages_from_prior_sessions: none

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied
- fail_only_once_rules_applied:
    - A-001 (own invocation evidence): PASS — PREHANDOVER-session-064-wave6final-20260227.md committed
      at 2d1f795; iaa_audit_token field present; pre-verdict placeholder `PHASE_A_ADVISORY — 2026-02-27`
      is the expected pre-invocation state; foreman-v2-agent session-067 correctly submitting for
      Phase B blocking review now.
    - A-002 (no class exceptions): PASS — AAWP_MAT category; no agent contract files in PR; no
      class exemption claimed by foreman.
    - A-003 (ambiguity resolves to mandatory): PASS — no ambiguity; AAWP_MAT unambiguous.
    - A-004 (bootstrap compliance): PASS — agent-bootstrap tool called as absolute first action;
      no repo file read before Phase 1 completion.
- fail_only_once_updates: none (no new recurring patterns; clean delivery with Phase B activation)

  - Bundle completeness: all 4 artifacts present
  - §4.3 merge gate parity: PASS

    after this token is issued)

## Phase B Activation Note
This is the first session-012 invocation under PHASE_B_BLOCKING. Prior sessions 065 and 066
also completed Phase B invocations but commits were not preserved due to 403 push failures.
This session-012 is the canonical final record for this invocation chain.
The PREHANDOVER placeholder `PHASE_A_ADVISORY — 2026-02-27` reflects the state when Foreman
first wrote it; it will be updated by foreman-v2-agent session-067 with token reference
`IAA-012-20260227-PASS` as the post-invocation ceremony (Step 4.3b).

## Learning Notes
1. **Phase B activation pattern**: This is the first PHASE_B_BLOCKING invocation to produce a
   committed session record. The prior attempts (sessions 065/066) succeeded in issuing the
   token but failed at the push step. The governance workflow correctly re-invokes IAA in a new
   session rather than forwarding the prior advisory token. This "re-invocation on push failure"
   pattern is correct and does not compromise assurance integrity.

2. **Governance-only wave FCWT evidence chain**: When the PR contains no code changes, FCWT
   evidence must be traced to the most recent code-delivery session. In this case:
   session-063 (api-builder Wave 9) → IAA-verified in session-011 → session-064 records as FCWT.
   This evidence chain is sound as long as no code was introduced between session-011 and this
   session-012 audit. Confirmed: the only code-modifying commits between session-063 and session-064
   are the Wave 6 Final governance artifacts themselves (no test-affecting changes).

3. **QAP CONDITIONAL PASS pattern**: A QAP verdict of CONDITIONAL PASS (with documented gaps
   targeting a known remediation issue) is a valid governance state for a wave closure. IAA
   should explicitly verify: (a) the condition is documented, (b) gaps are assigned to a
   remediation issue, (c) no gap constitutes a regression. All three conditions met in this PR.

4. **iaa_audit_token placeholder evolution**: The PREHANDOVER was created with
   `PHASE_A_ADVISORY — 2026-02-27` because Phase B was activated between the Foreman session and
   the IAA session. This is not a governance violation — the PREHANDOVER is a living artifact that
   gets its final token in the Step 4.3b ceremony. The key invariant is that IAA is invoked before
   the PR is merged, which is satisfied here (PR is still in draft state).

## Suggestions for Improvement

MANDATORY FIELD — populated:

1. **Phase B activation ceremony documentation**: Now that PHASE_B_BLOCKING is active, the
   governance system should formally document the Phase B activation event in the CANON_INVENTORY
   or a dedicated activation record. Currently there is no explicit `phase_b_activated_at` entry
   anywhere — the phase was declared active by the invoking context but not recorded in a
   persistent governance artifact. CS2 should add a formal Phase B activation record to ensure
   the activation date is unambiguous for future IAA audits.

2. **Continuous improvement note**: The evidence chain for governance-only waves
   (FCWT sourced from prior session → IAA verified in prior IAA session → Foreman records in
   tracker) is working well but creates an implicit dependency on session continuity. If the
   prior IAA session memory were lost (e.g., push failure), the evidence chain would be broken.
   A dedicated `fcwt-evidence.json` file committed alongside each FCWT-based tracker update
   would make the evidence chain explicit and self-contained in the PR bundle.

## Parking Station Entry
Appended to .agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md:
| 2026-02-27 | independent-assurance-agent | session-012 | Phase 4 | Document Phase B activation formally in a persistent governance artifact with activation date — currently only in invoking-agent context | session-012-20260227.md |
| 2026-02-27 | independent-assurance-agent | session-012 | Phase 4 | Add fcwt-evidence.json to governance-only wave PR bundles to make FCWT evidence chain explicit and self-contained | session-012-20260227.md |

## fail_only_once_updates
- none — no new recurring patterns that require a new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule. The Phase B
  activation pattern and re-invocation on push failure are expected behaviors, not governance
  failures. No rule addition warranted.
