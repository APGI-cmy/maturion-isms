---

## Phase 2 Alignment Record

**pr_reviewed**: copilot/upgrade-isms-iaa-qa-overlay — Upgrade ISMS IAA QA Overlay — Comprehensive Evidence, Integrity, and Cross-Wave Review Requirements (Wave 13+)

**invoking_agent**: CodexAdvisor-agent (session-039-20260302) / CS2 direct invocation

**producing_agent**: CodexAdvisor-agent (session-039-20260302)

**producing_agent_class**: overseer

**independence_check**: CONFIRMED — IAA (independent-assurance-agent) did not produce any artifact in this PR. Producing agent is CodexAdvisor-agent. No overlap.

**pr_category**: AMBIGUOUS → MANDATORY (REVIEW/KNOWLEDGE_GOVERNANCE — not defined in trigger table)

**category_classification_rationale**:
Files modified are `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/knowledge/` — Tier 2 knowledge files that directly govern IAA audit behavior. These do NOT match any of the 5 explicitly triggering categories (AGENT_CONTRACT: no `.github/agents/` files; CANON_GOVERNANCE: no `governance/canon/` files; CI_WORKFLOW: no `.github/workflows/` files; AAWP_MAT: not a MAT deliverable; AGENT_INTEGRITY: not in `governance/quality/agent-integrity/`). They are also NOT unambiguously doc-only/EXEMPT because they change IAA's operational checklists. Classification: AMBIGUOUS. FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-003: ambiguity resolves to MANDATORY invocation.

**iaa_triggered**: YES — AMBIGUITY RULE applied (FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-003)

**foreman_builder_mandate_check**: NOT APPLICABLE — no agent contract files in diff

**ambiguity_check**: AMBIGUITY RESOLVED — IAA required (Tier 2 knowledge changes govern IAA behavior; not unambiguously doc-only)

**no_overlay_applicable**: NO defined overlay for AMBIGUOUS/REVIEW/KNOWLEDGE_GOVERNANCE category. Core invariants ALL-applicable only. Gap noted in learning_notes (see below). CodexAdvisor correctly stated "N/A for S1–S6 agent contract gates" — the AGENT_CONTRACT overlay (including OVL-AC-011/012) does not apply to Tier 2 knowledge files.
## Phase 2 Alignment

**Invocation context**:
- PR: copilot/standardize-iaa-token-naming — Governance correction: IAA token standardization
- Invoked by: foreman-v2-agent (session-085)
- Work produced by: foreman-v2-agent (session-085)
- Producing agent class: foreman

**Independence check**: CONFIRMED — I (IAA session-084) did not produce any artifact in this PR. The correction was produced by foreman-v2-agent session-085. I issued the original session-083 token that is being corrected, but I am reviewing the foreman's correction work — not my own.

**PR category**: MIXED
- Tier 2 knowledge patches: `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md` (v1.9.0→v2.0.0), `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/index.md` (v1.4.0→v1.5.0) — TRIGGERING per FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-015
- Session memory corrections: `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-084-wave13-plan-20260302.md`, `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/memory/session-083-20260302.md` — non-triggering (session memory)
- Parking station: `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md` — non-triggering
- Classification: MIXED (triggering + non-triggering artifacts)

**IAA triggered**: YES — MIXED category triggers IAA; Tier 2 knowledge patches are explicitly non-exempt per FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-015 "No Content-Type Exemption"; A-003 ambiguity rule also confirms

**Foreman/builder mandate check**: NOT APPLICABLE — no .github/agents/ modifications in this PR

**Ambiguity check**: CLEAR — MIXED category; A-015 removes any content-type exemption claim

**Checklists loaded**:
- Core invariants: 17 checks loaded; 8 applicable (CORE-005, CORE-006, CORE-007, CORE-013, CORE-014, CORE-015, CORE-016, CORE-017); 9 N/A (AGENT_CONTRACT-only: CORE-001 to CORE-004, CORE-008 to CORE-012)
- AAWP_MAT overlay: OVL-AM-001, OVL-AM-002, OVL-AM-003 (3 checks — closest overlay for agent-workspace governance deliverables)
- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE: A-001, A-002, A-004, A-005, A-006, A-015 (Tier 2 PREHANDOVER) reviewed
- Total applicable checks: 17 evaluated

## Phase 3 Assurance Work

### FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Learning Applied

| Rule | Check | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| A-001 | IAA invocation evidence present in PR artifacts | PASS — PREHANDOVER proof committed with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`; ceremony in progress |
| A-002 | No class exemption claim | PASS — CodexAdvisor correctly stated IAA required via AMBIGUITY RULE; no exemption claimed |
| A-003 | Ambiguity → mandatory invocation | PASS — AMBIGUITY RULE correctly applied in PREHANDOVER classification |
| A-004 | Bootstrap directive complied | PASS — agent-bootstrap called as first action |
| A-005 | No .github/agents/ modifications | PASS — branch diff contains zero `.github/agents/` changes |
| A-006 | INC-IAA-SKIP-001 detection | PASS — `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` is correct mid-ceremony state; NOT a bare `PHASE_A_ADVISORY — YYYY-MM-DD` fabrication |
| A-015 | Full PREHANDOVER ceremony required | PASS — PREHANDOVER proof + session memory both present and committed on branch |
| A-016 | Cross-PR token reuse | PASS — N/A (PENDING state; cross-check triggers only when token is non-PENDING) |
| A-017 | REJECTION-as-PASS citation | PASS — N/A (PENDING state) |

**A-001 invocation evidence check**: PRESENT — PREHANDOVER proof at `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-039-20260302.md` with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`
**A-002 no-class-exceptions check**: CONFIRMED — no exemption claimed; AMBIGUITY RULE applied

### Core Invariants Checklist Results

| Check ID | Name | Applies | Evidence | Verdict |
|----------|------|---------|----------|---------|
| CORE-001 | YAML frontmatter valid | AGENT_CONTRACT only | N/A — no `.github/agents/*.md` files modified | N/A ✅ |
| CORE-002 | Agent version correct | AGENT_CONTRACT only | N/A | N/A ✅ |
| CORE-003 | Contract version present | AGENT_CONTRACT only | N/A | N/A ✅ |
| CORE-004 | Identity block complete | AGENT_CONTRACT only | N/A | N/A ✅ |
| CORE-005 | Governance block present | ALL | PREHANDOVER proof contains: CANON_INVENTORY alignment (190 canons, 0 placeholder hashes), CS2 authorization documentation, merge gate parity attestation. Governance attestation complete. | PASS ✅ |
| CORE-006 | CANON_INVENTORY alignment | ALL | IAA contract expected_artifacts: [governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json, governance/canon/INDEPENDENT_ASSURANCE_AGENT_CANON.md] — both present, CANON_INVENTORY has 190 entries, 0 hash issues, IAA canon present. PREHANDOVER states "190 canons, 0 degraded hashes". | PASS ✅ |
| CORE-007 | No placeholder content | ALL | Scanned iaa-core-invariants-checklist.md, iaa-category-overlays.md, index.md, PREHANDOVER proof, session memory. All new check content (CORE-018/019/020, OVL-AC-011/012, OVL-CG-005/006, OVL-CI-005/006, OVL-AM-004-007) fully described — no stub/TODO/FIXME. Grep matches were false positives: "to be populated" appears only in CORE-007 check description (listing search terms), "STUB" appears only in version history notes ("Initial STUB... STUB status removed"). PREHANDOVER `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` has "(To be populated after IAA invocation...)" annotation — explicitly valid per CORE-016/CORE-018 PENDING carve-out. | PASS ✅ |
| CORE-008 | Prohibitions block present | AGENT_CONTRACT only | N/A | N/A ✅ |
| CORE-009 | Merge gate interface present | AGENT_CONTRACT only | N/A | N/A ✅ |
| CORE-010 | Tier 2 knowledge indexed | AGENT_CONTRACT only | N/A | N/A ✅ |
| CORE-011 | Four-phase structure present | AGENT_CONTRACT only | N/A | N/A ✅ |
| CORE-012 | Self-modification lock present | AGENT_CONTRACT only | N/A | N/A ✅ |
| CORE-013 | IAA invocation evidence | ALL | PREHANDOVER proof present at `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-039-20260302.md` with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`. Session memory at `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/session-039-20260302.md`. Evidence bundle present. | PASS ✅ |
| CORE-014 | No class exemption claim | ALL | PREHANDOVER states "IAA required: REVIEW — resolves to mandatory per AMBIGUITY RULE". No exemption claimed. | PASS ✅ |
| CORE-015 | Session memory present | ALL | `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/session-039-20260302.md` — EXISTS and committed on branch. | PASS ✅ |
| CORE-016 | IAA tool call evidenced | ALL | `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` with `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section present in PREHANDOVER proof. PENDING is explicitly defined as a valid mid-ceremony state (CORE-016 detail, updated in this same PR). IAA is being called now — this is the invocation. | PASS ✅ |
| CORE-017 | No .github/agents/ modifications by unauthorized agent | ALL | Branch diff shows: `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/PREHANDOVER-*.md`, `.agent-workspace/CodexAdvisor-agent/memory/session-*.md`, `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/knowledge/*.md`, `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md` — ZERO `.github/agents/` files. | PASS ✅ |
| CORE-018 | Complete evidence artifact sweep | ALL | (a) PREHANDOVER proof: EXISTS ✓ (b) Session memory: EXISTS ✓ (c) `iaa_audit_token`: PRESENT, non-empty, value is "PENDING" (not a generic placeholder) ✓ (d) `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section: PRESENT in PREHANDOVER proof ✓ | PASS ✅ |
| CORE-019 | IAA token cross-verification | ALL | `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` — cross-verification check triggers only for non-PENDING tokens. N/A for current mid-ceremony PENDING state. | PASS ✅ (N/A — PENDING) |
| CORE-020 | Zero partial pass rule | ALL | All applicable checks evaluated with specific evidence. No assumed passes. All N/A checks have explicit scope justification (AGENT_CONTRACT only). No unverifiable evidence encountered. | PASS ✅ |

### Category Overlay Results

**Overlay applicable**: NONE — PR category is AMBIGUOUS/REVIEW; no defined overlay for Tier 2 knowledge updates in the trigger table. AGENT_CONTRACT overlay (OVL-AC-001 through OVL-AC-012) does not apply — these files are not `.github/agents/*.md`. No other overlay category matches. Core invariants alone apply.

**Governance gap noted**: No KNOWLEDGE_GOVERNANCE or TIER2_KNOWLEDGE overlay category exists. Future trigger table update should define this category with appropriate overlay checks including drift verification for Tier 2 knowledge files. See learning_notes.

## Content Quality Assessment (Non-Blocking Notes)

The following observations are informational and do NOT constitute REJECTION conditions:

1. **CORE-007 / CORE-016 interaction**: CORE-007 lists "to be populated" as a prohibited placeholder. CORE-016/CORE-018 create an explicit carve-out for the PENDING mid-ceremony state. These two rules have an implicit priority ordering (specific overrides general) that is not explicitly documented. A future patch should add a note to CORE-007: "Exception: `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` is exempt from this check (see CORE-016 detail)."

2. **REVIEW/KNOWLEDGE_GOVERNANCE category not defined**: The trigger table has no explicit category for Tier 2 knowledge updates. The AMBIGUITY RULE correctly resolved this invocation. A future CodexAdvisor session should add a `KNOWLEDGE_GOVERNANCE` category to the trigger table with appropriate overlay checks (e.g., drift verification for knowledge files, version bump check, index.md consistency check). This closes the governance gap observed in this session.

3. **FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md duplicate rule IDs (A-004×2, A-016×2)**: Flagged in sessions 030, 031, 032, 035, 082, and 084 parking station entries. This has been escalated 6+ times without resolution. A dedicated CodexAdvisor session must renumber the second A-004 to A-018 and second A-016 to A-019. Each additional session that records this without resolving it degrades the governance registry's integrity.

## Additional Observation (non-blocking)

The grep for non-canonical `IAA-WAVE*` tokens revealed historical artifacts predating A-015 in older foreman session files (sessions 055, 057, 058, 060, 063, 064, 069). These use formats such as `IAA-WAVE9-20260226-PASS`, `IAA-WAVE6-20260225-PASS`, etc. These predate the A-015 rule introduced by this very PR. The scope of this correction wave was explicitly sessions 083/084 (per the follow-up issue from PR #776). Retroactive correction of all pre-A-015 historical artifacts is out of scope for this wave and would require CS2 direction. Flagged as S-013 improvement suggestion below.

## Learning Notes

**NEW PATTERN — Tier 2 knowledge update category gap**:
This session is the first to formally audit a Tier 2 knowledge update PR under PHASE_B_BLOCKING. The trigger table correctly resolves via AMBIGUITY RULE, but there is no defined overlay for Tier 2 knowledge changes. Future invocations of this category will face the same classification ambiguity. A `KNOWLEDGE_GOVERNANCE` category (or `TIER2_KNOWLEDGE`) should be formally defined in `iaa-trigger-table.md` with a dedicated overlay in `iaa-category-overlays.md`. Suggested overlay checks:
- OVL-KG-001: Version bump present in all modified Tier 2 knowledge files
- OVL-KG-002: index.md updated to reflect all version changes
- OVL-KG-003: No FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule IDs collide with existing rules
- OVL-KG-004: Drift verification — git diff excerpt showing exact scope of change (prevents silent overwrites)
- OVL-KG-005: CORE-007 / CORE-016 interaction — exclude check description text from placeholder scan

**CORE-007 false positive risk**: Automated placeholder scanning of checklist files will trigger false positives when check descriptions list the very terms they prohibit (e.g., CORE-007 description contains "to be populated" as a search example). When applying CORE-007 programmatically, the check description column must be excluded from the placeholder scan. IAA should apply CORE-007 only to non-metadata content in delivered artifacts.

**Duplicate FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule IDs — escalation critical**: A-004×2 and A-016×2 have been recorded in 6+ sessions without resolution. This must be resolved in the next CodexAdvisor session. Continued deferral risks confusion when A-004 or A-016 is cited in a finding — it is ambiguous which rule is meant.

## Fail-Only-Once Updates

No new rules added this session. The Tier 2 knowledge category gap is noted as a **learning note** and escalated to parking station. If this same ambiguity recurs in a future session without a defined KNOWLEDGE_GOVERNANCE category, a formal A-018 rule should be created to mandate the AMBIGUITY RULE for all Tier 2 knowledge update PRs.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY)

1. **Add KNOWLEDGE_GOVERNANCE trigger category to `iaa-trigger-table.md`**: Define a formal trigger category for Tier 2 knowledge updates (`.agent-workspace/*/knowledge/` files) with a corresponding overlay in `iaa-category-overlays.md`. Suggested overlay checks: version bump verification, index.md consistency, git diff scope confirmation, FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule ID collision check. This closes the governance gap observed in this session. (Phase 2 — AMBIGUOUS classification)

2. **Resolve FAIL-ONLY-ONCE duplicate rule IDs in CodexAdvisor's next session**: Renumber second A-004 (post-merge retrospective) to A-018 and second A-016 (trigger table misapplication) to A-019. This has been escalated 6+ times. Add A-018/A-019 references to all checklist entries that currently reference the ambiguous A-016/A-004. (Escalation overdue — sessions 030, 031, 032, 035, 082, 084)

3. **Add CORE-007 exception note for PENDING state**: Add an explicit note to CORE-007 description: "Exception: the `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` annotation is exempt from this check (governed by CORE-016 and CORE-018 instead)." This prevents future false-positive REJECTION-PACKAGEs. Note on duplicate ID numbering: second A-004 → A-018, second A-016 → A-019 (to preserve correct sequential ordering). (Phase 3 — CORE-007 false positive analysis)

## Parking Station (Mandatory)

All in-session suggestions appended to `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md` — see Step 4.3 below.

**Session closed**: 2026-03-02
**Verdict**: ASSURANCE-TOKEN
**Token reference**: IAA-session-084-20260302-PASS
**Merge authority**: CS2 ONLY (@APGI-cmy)
**Authority**: CS2 (Johan Ras) | **Living Agent System**: v6.2.0
1. **Tier 2 knowledge patches are correctly non-exempt per A-015**: The Foreman correctly invoked IAA for a Tier 2 knowledge update (FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md + index.md). This confirms A-015 ("No Content-Type Exemption") is working as intended — the Foreman did not attempt to claim an EXEMPT classification for a governance correction session.

2. **CS2-authorized cross-workspace corrections are legitimate**: The Foreman modified IAA's own session memory (`.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/memory/session-083-20260302.md`) under CS2 authorization (issue assignment). This is the correct pattern when IAA itself cannot self-correct a historical artifact. The factual nature of the correction (1 token format change), explicit CS2 wave-start authorization, and the PREHANDOVER ceremony all make this acceptable.

3. **PENDING state (pre-ceremony) vs PENDING state (post-ceremony)**: The PREHANDOVER proof is submitted to IAA with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` (correct). After token issuance, the Foreman completes the ceremony by populating the verbatim section and committing all 7 files (5 staged + 2 untracked). This session confirms the ceremony sequence is working correctly.

4. **Historical non-canonical tokens exist in older artifacts**: Many foreman session files (sessions 055–069) contain tokens in `IAA-WAVE{N}-*` format that predate A-015. These are historical records and are not retroactively out-of-compliance. However, a future governance maintenance wave should assess whether these need standardization for archival clarity. See S-013.

5. **Scope discipline is correct**: The Foreman correctly scoped this wave to the specific artifacts flagged in the follow-up issue (sessions 083/084) rather than attempting to retroactively correct all historical artifacts. Over-scoping would have been a POLC violation. The targeted scope + FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule update is the correct pattern.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

**Mandatory suggestion (concrete, actionable)**: Multiple older foreman session files (sessions 055, 057, 058, 060, 063, 064, 069) contain non-canonical IAA tokens in `IAA-WAVE{N}-*` format predating A-015. A future governance maintenance wave should assess whether these historical artifacts should be retroactively standardized for archival consistency. This would require CS2 direction and a separate issue assignment (S-013). Until then, A-015 applies prospectively only. Recommendation: CS2 should decide whether to file a retroactive correction issue or declare pre-A-015 tokens as permanently grandfathered.

---

## fail_only_once_updates

No new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rules added this session (no new governance failure pattern observed — the historical token finding is an observation, not a new rule-requiring failure). The retroactive token observation is recorded as S-013 improvement suggestion in parking station.
