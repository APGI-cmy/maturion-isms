## Phase 2 Alignment

**Invocation context**:
- PR: copilot/standardize-iaa-token-naming — Governance correction: IAA token standardization
- Invoked by: foreman-v2-agent (session-085)
- Work produced by: foreman-v2-agent (session-085)
- Producing agent class: foreman

**Independence check**: CONFIRMED — I (IAA session-084) did not produce any artifact in this PR. The correction was produced by foreman-v2-agent session-085. I issued the original session-083 token that is being corrected, but I am reviewing the foreman's correction work — not my own.

**PR category**: MIXED
- Tier 2 knowledge patches: `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md` (v1.9.0→v2.0.0), `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/index.md` (v1.4.0→v1.5.0) — TRIGGERING per FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-015
- Session memory corrections: `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/PREHANDOVER-session-084-wave13-plan-20260302.md`, `.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/memory/session-083-20260302.md` — non-triggering (session memory)
- Parking station: `.agent-workspace/parking-station/suggestions-log.md` — non-triggering
- Classification: MIXED (triggering + non-triggering artifacts)

**IAA triggered**: YES — MIXED category triggers IAA; Tier 2 knowledge patches are explicitly non-exempt per FAIL-ONLY-ONCE A-015 "No Content-Type Exemption"; A-003 ambiguity rule also confirms

**Foreman/builder mandate check**: NOT APPLICABLE — no .github/agents/ modifications in this PR

**Ambiguity check**: CLEAR — MIXED category; A-015 removes any content-type exemption claim

**Checklists loaded**:
- Core invariants: 17 checks loaded; 8 applicable (CORE-005, CORE-006, CORE-007, CORE-013, CORE-014, CORE-015, CORE-016, CORE-017); 9 N/A (AGENT_CONTRACT-only: CORE-001 to CORE-004, CORE-008 to CORE-012)
- AAWP_MAT overlay: OVL-AM-001, OVL-AM-002, OVL-AM-003 (3 checks — closest overlay for agent-workspace governance deliverables)
- FAIL-ONLY-ONCE: A-001, A-002, A-004, A-005, A-006, A-015 (Tier 2 PREHANDOVER) reviewed
- Total applicable checks: 17 evaluated

## Adoption Phase Modifier

PHASE_B_BLOCKING — verdicts are hard-blocking. REJECTION-PACKAGE prevents PR from being opened.

## Merge Gate Parity (§4.3)

| Check | Local Result |
|-------|-------------|
| Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict | PASS ✅ — all staged MD files well-formed; 0 governance check failures |
| Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment | PASS ✅ — CANON_INVENTORY: 0 files modified (correct); .github/agents/: 0 changes; A-015 present (3 refs); non-canonical tokens purged from both target files; FAIL-ONLY-ONCE v2.0.0; Knowledge Index v1.5.0; parking station session-085 entry present |
| Merge Gate Interface / stop-and-fix/enforcement | PASS ✅ — breach registry: 0 open blockers; no outstanding REJECTION-PACKAGEs on copilot/standardize-iaa-token-naming branch |

**Parity result**: PASS — all 3 merge gate checks pass locally.

## Additional Observation (non-blocking)

The grep for non-canonical `IAA-WAVE*` tokens revealed historical artifacts predating A-015 in older foreman session files (sessions 055, 057, 058, 060, 063, 064, 069). These use formats such as `IAA-WAVE9-20260226-PASS`, `IAA-WAVE6-20260225-PASS`, etc. These predate the A-015 rule introduced by this very PR. The scope of this correction wave was explicitly sessions 083/084 (per the follow-up issue from PR #776). Retroactive correction of all pre-A-015 historical artifacts is out of scope for this wave and would require CS2 direction. Flagged as S-013 improvement suggestion below.

---

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

| Rule | Applied | Outcome |
|------|---------|---------|
| A-001 | YES | PASS — PREHANDOVER-session-085 present |
| A-002 | YES | PASS — no class exemption claim |
| A-004 | YES | PASS — bootstrap directive complied |
| A-005 | YES | PASS — no .github/agents/ changes |
| A-006 | YES | PASS — no fabricated PHASE_A_ADVISORY pattern |
| A-015 (Tier 2 PREHANDOVER) | YES | PASS — PREHANDOVER ceremony present for Tier 2 knowledge patch |

---

## Learning Notes

1. **Tier 2 knowledge patches are correctly non-exempt per A-015**: The Foreman correctly invoked IAA for a Tier 2 knowledge update (FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md + index.md). This confirms A-015 ("No Content-Type Exemption") is working as intended — the Foreman did not attempt to claim an EXEMPT classification for a governance correction session.

2. **CS2-authorized cross-workspace corrections are legitimate**: The Foreman modified IAA's own session memory (`.agent-workspace/independent-assurance-agent/memory/session-083-20260302.md`) under CS2 authorization (issue assignment). This is the correct pattern when IAA itself cannot self-correct a historical artifact. The factual nature of the correction (1 token format change), explicit CS2 wave-start authorization, and the PREHANDOVER ceremony all make this acceptable.

3. **PENDING state (pre-ceremony) vs PENDING state (post-ceremony)**: The PREHANDOVER proof is submitted to IAA with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` (correct). After token issuance, the Foreman completes the ceremony by populating the verbatim section and committing all 7 files (5 staged + 2 untracked). This session confirms the ceremony sequence is working correctly.

4. **Historical non-canonical tokens exist in older artifacts**: Many foreman session files (sessions 055–069) contain tokens in `IAA-WAVE{N}-*` format that predate A-015. These are historical records and are not retroactively out-of-compliance. However, a future governance maintenance wave should assess whether these need standardization for archival clarity. See S-013.

5. **Scope discipline is correct**: The Foreman correctly scoped this wave to the specific artifacts flagged in the follow-up issue (sessions 083/084) rather than attempting to retroactively correct all historical artifacts. Over-scoping would have been a POLC violation. The targeted scope + FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rule update is the correct pattern.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

**Mandatory suggestion (concrete, actionable)**: Multiple older foreman session files (sessions 055, 057, 058, 060, 063, 064, 069) contain non-canonical IAA tokens in `IAA-WAVE{N}-*` format predating A-015. A future governance maintenance wave should assess whether these historical artifacts should be retroactively standardized for archival consistency. This would require CS2 direction and a separate issue assignment (S-013). Until then, A-015 applies prospectively only. Recommendation: CS2 should decide whether to file a retroactive correction issue or declare pre-A-015 tokens as permanently grandfathered.

---

## fail_only_once_updates

No new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rules added this session (no new governance failure pattern observed — the historical token finding is an observation, not a new rule-requiring failure). The retroactive token observation is recorded as S-013 improvement suggestion in parking station.
