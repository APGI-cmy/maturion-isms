## Failures Cited

### FAIL-1: OVL-KG-002 — Knowledge Version Not Bumped

**Finding**: `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/index.md` was modified (one line changed: table row for `index.md` from `1.2.0` → `1.6.0`) but the `**Knowledge Version**` header remains at `1.6.0`. OVL-KG-002 requires all Tier 2 knowledge file modifications to be accompanied by a version increment. No carve-out exists for cosmetic corrections in OVL-KG-002. The rule is unconditional.

**Fix required**: Bump `**Knowledge Version**` header from `1.6.0` to `1.6.1`. Update table row for `index.md` from `1.6.0` to `1.6.1`. Patch increment is appropriate for cosmetic consistency correction.

### FAIL-2: OVL-KG-003 — Version History Table Absent

**Finding**: `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/knowledge/index.md` contains no `## Version History` table. OVL-KG-003 requires every modified Tier 2 knowledge file's version history table to include an entry for the new version. Pre-existing gap, but OVL-KG-003 activates on modification. "Missing or stale version history = REJECTION-PACKAGE."

**Fix required**: Add a `## Version History` section to `index.md`. Include entry for v1.6.1: `| 1.6.1 | 2026-03-02 | Corrected version table row for index.md from 1.2.0 to 1.6.0 (cosmetic drift fix; PR #785 identified; issue #788 Step 0) |`.

---

## Advisory Finding (not a hard fail — no current check covers this)

**Branch name discrepancy in PREHANDOVER proof**: The PREHANDOVER proof states `**Branch**: copilot/wave13-mat-deployment-wiring-regression` but the actual git branch is `copilot/fix-live-deployment-wiring-regression`. These do not match. Recommend correcting during remediation. A new check/rule should be proposed to cover PREHANDOVER branch name accuracy (see learning notes).

---

## Learning Notes

1. **OVL-KG-002/003 first foreman application**: This is the first time OVL-KG overlay checks (v2.2.0, added 2026-03-02) were applied to a foreman-v2 knowledge file modification. The checks correctly identified that the foreman-v2 knowledge index lacked a version history table — a pre-existing gap now mandatorily exposed by the overlay. Future foreman-v2 knowledge file PRs will be expected to include version history tables per OVL-KG-003.

2. **Cosmetic fix + version bump principle**: The Foreman's intent — correcting a display inconsistency where a table row said 1.2.0 but the header already said 1.6.0 — is correct and the underlying change is accurate. However, OVL-KG-002 does not carve out "cosmetic drift corrections" from the version bump requirement. Even a 1-character edit to a knowledge file requires a patch version bump. This creates a bootstrapping problem for "the version was already right, I'm just fixing a stale table row" scenarios — but the rule is unambiguous, and the correct resolution (1.6.1 for cosmetic fix) is straightforward.

3. **PREHANDOVER branch name accuracy gap**: The PREHANDOVER proof contained `copilot/wave13-mat-deployment-wiring-regression` as the branch name, but the actual working branch is `copilot/fix-live-deployment-wiring-regression`. No current CORE or OVL-KG check explicitly validates PREHANDOVER branch name accuracy. This is a low-severity but real evidence consistency gap. Proposing a new rule (A-020 candidate) to require PREHANDOVER branch name to match the actual git branch at time of IAA invocation.

4. **Session 085 precedent**: Session 085 established ASSURANCE-TOKEN for the KNOWLEDGE_GOVERNANCE trigger and overlay framework itself. This session (086) is the first application of those overlays to a different agent's knowledge files. The overlays work as designed — they correctly caught OVL-KG-002/003 gaps.

---

## fail_only_once_updates

No new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rules added this session. A-020 candidate (PREHANDOVER branch name accuracy) noted in learning notes and parking station for future session assessment. Pattern requires at least 2 sessions of recurrence before FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registration (per learning integration protocol).

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

**S-new-branch-name**: The PREHANDOVER proof should have its `**Branch**` field verified against the actual `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` output before IAA invocation. The foreman-v2 PREHANDOVER template (`prehandover-template.md`) should add a note reminding agents to verify the branch name field against the live git branch. This is consistent with the evidence accuracy principle already embedded in CORE-018. Propose as Foreman S-014: "Add branch name self-verification step to Phase 4 PREHANDOVER template — verify `**Branch**` field matches `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` before invoking IAA."

No degradation of IAA checklist observed. Continuous improvement note: OVL-KG overlays are working as designed — first external application to foreman-v2 knowledge files exposed a pre-existing gap (missing version history table) which the overlays correctly flagged. The overlay framework is functioning correctly.

---

## Post-REJECTION-PACKAGE Ceremony Mandates

The following items are required of foreman-v2-agent before re-invocation:
1. Bump `**Knowledge Version**` in `index.md` from `1.6.0` to `1.6.1`
2. Update table row for `index.md` from `1.6.0` to `1.6.1`
3. Add `## Version History` section to `index.md` with entry for v1.6.1
4. Correct `**Branch**` field in PREHANDOVER proof (advisory — recommended)
5. Update PREHANDOVER proof `iaa_audit_token` field to PENDING (remains correct — ceremony continues)
6. Paste verbatim IAA output (this response) into `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section of PREHANDOVER proof
7. Re-invoke IAA after all remediation steps complete
