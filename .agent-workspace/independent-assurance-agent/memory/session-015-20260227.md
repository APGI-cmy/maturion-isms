## fail_only_once_updates

- A-005 confirmed present in IAA FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry per CS2 directive 2026-02-27 — no new addition needed
- A-013 confirmed present in Foreman FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry — consistent cross-registry
- No new recurring pattern identified this session beyond patterns already captured in A-005 and session-014 learning notes
- No new entries added this session

---

## Learning Notes

1. **Round 2 pattern — fast fixes resolve cleanly**: The Round 1 REJECTION-PACKAGE was for 6 header field fixes across 2 files. All 6 were correctly applied and verified. The STOP-AND-FIX cycle (reject → fix → re-invoke) worked exactly as designed. No governance gaps identified in the Round 2 process.
2. **Shallow clone artifact — no AGENT_CONTRACT false positive**: Confirmed again in Round 2: diff-filter=M on the grafted root commit returns 0 `.github/agents/` modifications. The A-005 check correctly evaluates to PASS. This pattern is now well-understood and documented.
3. **CS2 directives during a REJECTION-PACKAGE cycle**: CS2 issued two additional directives (A-013 to Foreman, A-005 to IAA) during the Round 1 → Round 2 window. These were correctly added to the respective FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registries before Round 2 re-invocation. IAA should verify CS2 directives are applied to relevant registries before re-invoking.
4. **Independent test re-run**: Both api/ai (41/41) and full monorepo (368/368) were re-run independently in Round 2. All GREEN. IAA test verification should always be independent, not relying solely on PREHANDOVER claims.
5. **Version header discipline**: Session-014 identified the "content added, header forgotten" pattern. Round 1 fix corrected all 6 fields. The fix was clean and complete. Future audits should verify ALL spec headers (not just the most recently changed ones) as a matter of discipline.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Round 2 PREHANDOVER checklist item**: When foreman re-invokes IAA after a REJECTION-PACKAGE, the PREHANDOVER proof should include a explicit "Round N Re-invocation Record" section listing each Round 1 failure, the applied fix, and a verification step. This session's PREHANDOVER proof did include this; it should be standardised as a mandatory PREHANDOVER template section for all re-invocations. Recommend flagging to CS2/CodexAdvisor for template update.
2. **Spec header validation automation (reiterated from session-014)**: The pattern of correct changelog + incorrect header fields is a repeatable error vector. A lightweight CI check that extracts the `**Version**:` and `**Last Updated**:` fields from governance spec headers and compares them to the most recent changelog entry would catch this automatically before IAA invocation. This would reduce round-trip time on future PRs.
