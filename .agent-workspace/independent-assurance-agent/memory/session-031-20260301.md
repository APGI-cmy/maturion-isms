## Phase 3 Assurance Work

### FAIL-ONLY-ONCE learning checks

| Rule | Applied? | Result | Note |
|------|---------|--------|------|
| A-001 | NO | N/A | Not AGENT_CONTRACT |
| A-002 | NO | N/A | Not AGENT_CONTRACT |
| A-003 | YES | PASS | governance/EXECUTION/ ambiguity resolved to mandatory |
| A-005 | YES | PASS | No .github/agents/ modifications |
| A-006 | YES | PASS | No fabricated PHASE_A_ADVISORY tokens in primary audit artifacts; governance-liaison session-032 HANDOVER_SUMMARY has incorrect iaa_invocation_result: PHASE_A_ADVISORY but does not match exact A-006 pattern; Foreman correctly invoked IAA |

| A-017 | YES | PASS | IAA-023-PASS is genuine ASSURANCE-TOKEN (session-023 second sub-invocation Wave COMBINED-PLAN, line 440-441) |

### Core Invariants (applicable)

| Check | Verdict | Evidence |
|-------|---------|---------|
| CORE-005 | N/A | Planning documents; no YAML governance block |

### Confirmed clean items (no failures)

## Phase 4 Verdict

**checks_executed**: 14 (8 CORE + 3 OVL-AM + 3 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE applicable); 5 N/A with justification
**checks_passed**: 9
**checks_failed**: 5 (CORE-013, CORE-015, CORE-016, OVL-AM-002, OVL-AM-003 + A-015 as root cause overlap)
**merge_gate_parity_result**: FAIL — merge-gate/verdict and stop-and-fix/enforcement failed
**verdict**: REJECTION-PACKAGE
**token_reference**: N/A
**adoption_phase_at_time_of_verdict**: PHASE_B_BLOCKING

**failures_cited**:

1. CORE-013 / CORE-015 / CORE-016 / A-015 / OVL-AM-002 (root: missing pre-invocation ceremony)
   - Finding: Foreman session-082 invoked IAA without creating PREHANDOVER proof or session memory. `git status` clean — no PREHANDOVER proof exists on branch (committed or untracked).
   - Fix: Create PREHANDOVER proof + session memory, commit to branch, then re-invoke IAA.

2. OVL-AM-003 (AAWP stale version reference)
   - Finding: AAWP v0.4.0 references EXECUTION PLAN v1.3.0 in 4 locations; EXECUTION PLAN is v1.4.0 in this same PR.
   - Fix: Update all 4 EXECUTION PLAN version references in AIMC_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT_WAVE_PLAN.md from v1.3.0 → v1.4.0.

**advisory_findings**:
1. BUILD_PROGRESS_TRACKER "Overall Progress" says "554 tests GREEN" but DEPLOY-WIRED state machine row says "559/559 GREEN post-CWT" — reconcile these.
2. governance-liaison session-032 HANDOVER_SUMMARY iaa_invocation_result: PHASE_A_ADVISORY is factually incorrect (PHASE_B_BLOCKING since session-026). Should be corrected.

---

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry anomaly (flagged for CS2)

The FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md registry has **duplicate rule IDs**:
- A-004 appears TWICE (once for bootstrap directive, once for post-merge retrospective)
- A-016 appears TWICE (once for cross-PR token reuse, once for trigger table misapplication)

These are different rules sharing the same ID. This creates ambiguity in rule enforcement. Recommendation: renumber the second A-004 to A-018, and the second A-016 to A-019, with appropriate cross-references. This should be escalated to CS2 and CodexAdvisor for corrective action in the next governance maintenance wave.

---

## Learning Notes

1. **Session-023 multi-invocation pattern**: Session-023 contained THREE sub-invocations (Wave 12 REJECTION → Wave COMBINED-PLAN REJECTION → Wave COMBINED-PLAN ASSURANCE-TOKEN in second attempt on same session). The final verdict was ASSURANCE-TOKEN. When reviewing past sessions with mixed verdicts, IAA must read the FULL session file (not just grep for verdict lines) to determine the authoritative final outcome. The A-016/A-017 checks were initially triggered on session-023 before full review revealed the genuine ASSURANCE-TOKEN. Full file reads take precedence over grep-based initial assessments.

2. **Session-030 three-sub-invocation pattern confirmed**: Session-030 covered three separate PRs (CL-4, CL-3.5/CL-13 Kick-Off, Wave 12 Render Migration). Only CL-4 appeared in the YAML table header; CL-3.5 and Render migration appeared in the body. Multi-PR sessions must be fully read before A-016 checks are concluded. The pattern of reusing a session identifier across multiple PR audits in the same session is established and valid.

3. **Pre-invocation ceremony is mandatory even for "minor" documentation waves**: The Foreman described this as a "documentation-only" progress tracker reconciliation wave. Despite this, A-015 requires PREHANDOVER proof + session memory. The content type provides no exemption. The ceremony must always precede IAA invocation for triggered PRs.

4. **AAWP-EXECUTION PLAN cross-reference alignment in same-PR updates**: When two governance documents are updated in the same PR where one references the other's version number, BOTH must be aligned to the final version. The AAWP references must reflect v1.4.0 (not v1.3.0) because the EXECUTION PLAN is being bumped to v1.4.0 within the same commit. Future cross-document version references in the same PR must be checked for self-consistency at PR composition time, not just at merge time.

5. **FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry duplicate IDs require maintenance**: The FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md file has accumulated duplicate rule IDs (A-004 ×2, A-016 ×2) due to independent additions over multiple sessions. This reduces registry clarity and should be cleaned up. Recommend adding this to CodexAdvisor's governance maintenance backlog.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement (MANDATORY — never blank)

**S-001 (governance maintenance)**: The FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md registry has duplicate rule IDs (A-004, A-016 each appear twice with different content). Renumber the second A-004 → A-018 and second A-016 → A-019 to restore unique IDs and prevent rule enforcement confusion. This is a clean-up task for the next governance maintenance wave.

**S-002 (pre-invocation check)**: Consider adding a pre-invocation checklist item to the Foreman FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry explicitly listing the artifacts that MUST exist on branch before IAA is invoked: (1) PREHANDOVER proof with `iaa_audit_token: PENDING`, (2) session memory stub. This would catch session-082-type omissions at Foreman level before IAA invocation, reducing re-invocation overhead.

**S-003 (cross-document version alignment gate)**: When a PR modifies two documents where one references the other's version number, the pre-IAA ceremony should include a version alignment check: verify that referenced versions match the post-PR state. This could be added as an explicit PREHANDOVER proof section ("Cross-document version alignment: [document A] references [document B] at [version X] — post-PR version of B is [version Y] — [ALIGNED/MISALIGNED]").

| Date | Agent | Session | Phase | Summary | Session File |
|------|-------|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-031 | PHASE 3 | FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md has duplicate rule IDs (A-004 ×2, A-016 ×2) — renumber to restore unique IDs | session-031-20260301.md |
| 2026-03-01 | independent-assurance-agent | session-031 | PHASE 3 | Pre-invocation ceremony (PREHANDOVER + session memory) skipped by foreman-v2 session-082 for documentation wave — A-015 triggered; add Foreman-level ceremony reminder | session-031-20260301.md |

**prior_sessions_reviewed**: session-026, session-027, session-028, session-029, session-030, session-078, session-079 (+ session-025 partial; session-023 archive full read)
**fail_only_once_rules_applied**: A-003, A-005, A-006, A-015 (triggered), A-016, A-017
**fail_only_once_updates**: NONE new rules this session — session-023 multi-invocation pattern and AAWP cross-reference issue are learning notes, not new breach patterns requiring new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rules. FAIL-ONLY-ONCE registry duplicate ID anomaly flagged for cleanup (not a new rule).
