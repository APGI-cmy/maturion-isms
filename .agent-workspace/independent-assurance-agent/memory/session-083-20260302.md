## Adoption Phase Modifier

PHASE_B_BLOCKING — verdicts are hard-blocking.

---

## Merge Gate Parity (§4.3)

| Check | Local Result |
|-------|-------------|
| Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict | PASS — 0 checks failed |
| Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment | PASS — all governance artifacts well-formed, CANON_INVENTORY intact |
| Merge Gate Interface / stop-and-fix/enforcement | PASS — no STOP-AND-FIX conditions triggered |

**Parity result**: PASS — all 3 merge gate checks pass locally.

## Session-082 REJECTION-PACKAGE Remediation Verification

All 4 failure items from session-082 confirmed remediated:

| # | Original Failure | Remediation Status |
|---|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | A-001 + CORE-013: PREHANDOVER proof absent | ✅ PASS — proof committed in 2ecb4f6 |
| 2 | CORE-015: Session memory untracked | ✅ PASS — committed in 2ecb4f6 |
| 3 | CORE-016: No IAA Agent Response section | ✅ PASS — section present; PENDING state correct |
| 4 | OVL-AM-002: Evidence bundle incomplete | ✅ PASS — all 5 artifacts committed; working tree clean |

---

## FAIL-ONLY-ONCE Rules Applied

| Rule | Applied | Outcome |
|------|---------|---------|
| A-001 | YES | PASS — PREHANDOVER proof present |
| A-002 | YES | PASS — no class exemption claim |
| A-004 | YES | PASS — bootstrap directive complied |
| A-005 | YES | PASS — no .github/agents/ changes |
| A-006 | YES | PASS — no fabricated PHASE_A_ADVISORY pattern |
| A-016 | N/A | PENDING state — no token to cross-reference |
| A-017 | N/A | PENDING state — no session-NNN token cited |

## Learning Notes

1. **Re-audit workflow is clean and effective**: The REJECTION-PACKAGE → PREHANDOVER creation → commit all artifacts → re-invoke IAA sequence worked correctly. Session-084 foreman correctly followed all 4 fix steps from session-082. This is the expected re-audit resolution pattern.

2. **PENDING is the correct pre-token state**: `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` with the `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section present-but-empty is the correct state for a PREHANDOVER proof at the time of IAA invocation. CORE-016 and CORE-007 should not treat this as a failure — the verbatim section will be populated as post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN ceremony. The distinction between PENDING (correct) and PHASE_A_ADVISORY fabrication (failure) is important for future invocations.

3. **Ceremony anchor first**: The fix from session-082 (create PREHANDOVER proof before other steps, then commit everything as a bundle) is the correct pattern. The fact that session-084 remediated all 4 failures in a single commit confirms the fix sequence was correctly executed.

4. **Content quality sustained**: Session-082 confirmed high content quality (RCA MAT-RCA-002 with 12 failures, Wave 13 §2.14 with 24 test IDs, PBFAG checks 9-13). This re-audit confirms no content degradation — content quality is unchanged.

---

## Suggestions for Improvement

**Mandatory suggestion (concrete, actionable)**: The CORE-016 checklist description should be updated to explicitly state that `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` with `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section present is a PASS state (awaiting ceremony completion) — distinct from PHASE_A_ADVISORY fabrication (FAIL). Currently the checklist only defines explicit FAIL and PASS conditions, leaving PENDING in a gap. A third explicit state "PENDING — ceremony in progress — PASS conditional on post-token ceremony completion" would close this ambiguity. This protects against an overzealous future IAA invocation incorrectly failing a correctly-structured PREHANDOVER proof mid-ceremony.

---

## fail_only_once_updates

No new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rules added this session. The PENDING state clarification is a checklist improvement suggestion (noted above), not a new governance failure pattern. All existing rules functioned correctly.
