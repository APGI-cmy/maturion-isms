## Prior Session Review

**Open REJECTION-PACKAGEs from prior sessions**: session-086 issued REJECTION-PACKAGE (IAA-session-086-20260302-REJECT) for foreman-v2 Wave 13 Step 0 — two failures (OVL-KG-002, OVL-KG-003). This session is the re-invocation to verify those failures are resolved. No other open REJECTION-PACKAGEs from sessions 082–085.

**Remediation claimed**:
1. OVL-KG-002: `**Knowledge Version**` header bumped from 1.6.0 → 1.6.1; table row for `index.md` updated from 1.6.0 → 1.6.1
2. OVL-KG-003: `## Version History` table added with entry for v1.6.1
3. Advisory (non-blocking): Branch field in PREHANDOVER proof corrected to `copilot/fix-live-deployment-wiring-regression`

|---------|------|--------|
| 1.6.1 | 2026-03-02 | Corrected version table row for `index.md` from `1.2.0` to `1.6.1` — cosmetic drift from PR #785 (v1.3.0→v1.6.0 progression did not update table cell); version bumped on edit per OVL-KG-002 |
| 1.6.0 | 2026-03-02 | FAIL-ONLY-ONCE.md updated to v2.1.0 (INC-IAA-SKIP-002, A-016, S-013); prehandover-template.md added (PHASE 4 §S-009) |
```
**Verdict**: REMEDIATION CONFIRMED ✅

## Advisory Findings (non-blocking — no current check covers these)

**Advisory-1 — Session memory action description stale**: The foreman-v2 session-087 session memory `knowledge_maintenance_actions` block still records `action: Update version table row for index.md from 1.2.0 to 1.6.0` and `commit_message: "fix(knowledge): sync index.md version table row to 1.6.0"`. The actual remediated state moved the row to 1.6.1 (due to OVL-KG-002 version bump requirement). This is an inaccuracy in the session record — the description was written before the OVL-KG-002 failure was identified and was not updated post-remediation. No current CORE or OVL-KG check requires that session memory action descriptions be updated to reflect post-remediation final state. Non-blocking, but recorded for completeness.

Recommendation: The foreman should update the session-087 memory `knowledge_maintenance_actions` description and `commit_message` to say "to 1.6.1" rather than "to 1.6.0" for accuracy. (Advisory only — does not block ASSURANCE-TOKEN.)

---

## fail_only_once_updates

No new FAIL-ONLY-ONCE rules added this session. A-020 candidate (PREHANDOVER branch name accuracy) remains in parking station from session-086 — no second occurrence in this session to elevate it. The session memory action description stale reference (Advisory-1) is noted as a new A-020 candidate alongside the branch name issue, but a single session occurrence does not meet the recurrence threshold for registration. Both patterns will be monitored.

---

## Learning Notes

1. **OVL-KG-002 + OVL-KG-003 clean remediation**: The foreman-v2-agent correctly applied both fixes from session-086 REJECTION-PACKAGE. The version bump to 1.6.1 (not 1.6.0) correctly anticipates that OVL-KG-002 requires version increment on modification, and the version history entry accurately describes the final state "from 1.2.0 to 1.6.1". The remediation demonstrates the foreman understands the cascade: original intent was "fix drift to 1.6.0" but REJECTION-PACKAGE required "bump to 1.6.1", so the version history correctly records the final destination as 1.6.1. This is correct reasoning.

2. **Advisory fix applied without additional prompting**: The branch name advisory from session-086 was applied — PREHANDOVER proof `**Branch**` field corrected to `copilot/fix-live-deployment-wiring-regression`. This is exemplary behavior: the foreman applied non-blocking advisory corrections proactively, not just the hard-blocking items.

3. **Session memory not updated post-remediation**: The foreman-v2 session-087 session memory retains the pre-remediation description ("to 1.6.0"). This is a common pattern: session memories are typically written at phase 4 of the session and are not re-generated when post-IAA-REJECTION-PACKAGE fixes are applied. Future guidance: when remediation changes the final state of a knowledge file version, the session memory `knowledge_maintenance_actions` and `commit_message` should be updated to reflect the final state. Proposing as A-020 candidate (session memory post-remediation accuracy).

4. **Re-invocation ceremony executed correctly**: PREHANDOVER proof `iaa_audit_token: PENDING` correctly maintained (not pre-filled). `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section present (awaiting this response). Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN ceremony is now triggered: foreman must (a) update `iaa_audit_token` in both PREHANDOVER proof and session memory to `IAA-session-087-20260302-PASS`, (b) paste this complete IAA response verbatim in `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)`.

---

## Post-ASSURANCE-TOKEN Ceremony Requirements

The following steps are required of foreman-v2-agent to complete the ceremony:
1. Update `iaa_audit_token` in PREHANDOVER proof from `PENDING` to `IAA-session-087-20260302-PASS`
2. Update `iaa_audit_token` in session-087 session memory from `PENDING` to `IAA-session-087-20260302-PASS`
3. Paste this complete IAA session-087 response verbatim in `## IAA Agent Response (verbatim)` section of PREHANDOVER proof
4. (Advisory) Update session memory `knowledge_maintenance_actions` description and `commit_message` to say "to 1.6.1" instead of "to 1.6.0"
5. Commit all updates to branch `copilot/fix-live-deployment-wiring-regression`
6. Open PR targeting `main` — Merge authority: CS2 ONLY (@APGI-cmy)

## Suggestions for Improvement

**S-new-session-memory-post-remediation**: After a REJECTION-PACKAGE remediation, any session memory `knowledge_maintenance_actions` description or `commit_message` that references a version number that changed during remediation should be updated to reflect the final state. The foreman-v2 PREHANDOVER template (prehandover-template.md) and FAIL-ONLY-ONCE guidance should note: "After applying REJECTION-PACKAGE fixes that alter the final version number, update all session memory version references to the final committed state." This is consistent with the evidence accuracy principle in CORE-018 and extends it to session memory descriptive fields.

No degradation of IAA checklist observed this session. Continuous improvement note: The OVL-KG overlay is working reliably — this is the second application to foreman-v2 knowledge files and it correctly flagged the pre-existing gap (missing version history table) in session-086 and verified the fix in this session. The overlay framework is functioning correctly across two invocations.
