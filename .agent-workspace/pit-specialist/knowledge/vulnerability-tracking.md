## Overview

This knowledge file defines the vulnerability tracking and prioritisation workflow used by the PIT specialist within the Maturion ISMS platform.

---

## Vulnerability Data Sources

| Source | Type | Integration |
|---|---|---|
| NVD (NIST) | CVE catalogue + CVSS scores | NVD API v2 (stub) |
| MITRE CVE | CVE assignments | Cross-reference via NVD |
| Internal scan results | Asset-specific findings | Manual upload / API |
| Vendor advisories | Patch notifications | Feed ingestion |

## Vulnerability Schema

```json
{
  "vuln_id": "<uuid>",
  "cve_id": "CVE-YYYY-NNNNN",
  "cvss_score": 0.0-10.0,
  "cvss_vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/...",
  "severity": "critical | high | medium | low",
  "asset_id": "<asset-uuid>",
  "asset_criticality": "critical | high | medium | low",
  "exploitability": "weaponised | poc | theoretical | none",
  "patch_available": true,
  "patch_released": "<ISO8601>",
  "discovered_at": "<ISO8601>",
  "remediation_sla": "<ISO8601>",
  "status": "open | in_remediation | resolved | accepted_risk | false_positive",
  "tenant_id": "<tenant-uuid>"
}
```

## CVSS Severity Mapping

| CVSS Score | Severity | SLA |
|---|---|---|
| 9.0 – 10.0 | Critical | 24 hours |
| 7.0 – 8.9 | High | 7 days |
| 4.0 – 6.9 | Medium | 30 days |
| 0.1 – 3.9 | Low | 90 days |
| 0.0 | None | Best effort |

---

## Prioritisation Model

Effective priority = CVSS score × Asset Criticality Weight × Exploitability Multiplier

| Asset Criticality | Weight |
|---|---|
| Critical | 1.5 |
| High | 1.2 |
| Medium | 1.0 |
| Low | 0.7 |

| Exploitability | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| Weaponised | 2.0 |
| Proof of Concept | 1.5 |
| Theoretical | 1.0 |
| None | 0.8 |

---

## Remediation Workflow

1. **Discovery** — vulnerability ingested from source
2. **Enrichment** — CVSS, asset context, exploitability added
3. **Prioritisation** — effective priority computed
4. **SLA assignment** — based on severity tier
5. **Assignment** — routed to responsible team
6. **Remediation** — patch applied or compensating control
7. **Verification** — rescan or confirmation
8. **Closure** — status → resolved; evidence recorded

---

## Status Lifecycle

```
open → in_remediation → resolved
open → accepted_risk (risk-owner approval required)
open → false_positive (analyst review + evidence required)
```
