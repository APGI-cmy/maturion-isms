## 📚 Canonical References

Primary references:
- BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md
- LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md v6.2.0
- governance/canon/BUILDER_CONTRACT_BINDING_CHECKLIST.md
- governance/canon/FM_BUILDER_APPOINTMENT_PROTOCOL.md
- governance/canon/AGENT_FILE_BINDING_REQUIREMENTS.md
- governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json

Supporting references: 20+ additional governance documents (see Appendix D in detailed sections)

---

## 💡 Integration Recommendation

**Option A: Direct Replacement** (Recommended)

Replace lines 98-110 in stub file with full detailed content from `BUILDER_AGENT_FILE_COMPLIANCE_DETAILED_SECTIONS.md`

**Rationale**:
- Canonical governance artifacts should be complete and standalone
- Foreman and validators need single authoritative source
- Machine validators need complete rule set in one location
- File size (~52KB total) is reasonable for canonical governance
