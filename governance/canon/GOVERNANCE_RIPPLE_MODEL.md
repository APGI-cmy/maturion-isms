# GOVERNANCE RIPPLE MODEL

## Status
Canonical Governance Policy  
Version: v1.1.0  
Authority: Governance Administrator  
Effective Date: 2025-12-22  
Updated: 2026-02-21 (Terminology Clarification: Layering vs. Rippling)  
Required By: GOVERNANCE_PURPOSE_AND_SCOPE.md

---

## TERMINOLOGY CLARIFICATION (2026-02-21)

**IMPORTANT**: This document historically used "ripple" to describe both **cross-repository governance distribution** and **within-repository integration**. As of v1.1.0, terminology is clarified per **ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md v1.1.0**:

- **Layering Down**: Cross-repo distribution of governance artifacts (Governance → Consumer repos)
- **Layering Up**: Cross-repo propagation of learnings (Consumer repos → Governance)
- **Rippling**: Within-repo integration of layered artifacts (single repository only)

This document now uses **"layering"** for cross-repo flows and reserves **"rippling"** for within-repo integration. Historical sections retain "ripple" in headers for continuity but are clarified inline.

For full definitions, see **ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md v1.1.0** and **LAYERING_AND_RIPPLING_AUTOMATION_STRATEGY.md**.

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **Governance Layering and Rippling Model** - a bidirectional governance evolution framework that enables governance to adapt and improve while maintaining authority, consistency, and auditability.

The model ensures:
- Governance changes **layer down** to all governed repositories (cross-repo distribution)
- Lessons learned **layer up** from repositories to governance (cross-repo feedback)
- Layered artifacts **ripple** within each repository (intra-repo integration)
- Governance evolves without weakening enforcement
- Governance remains non-blocking while maintaining rigor
- All evolution is tracked, versioned, and auditable

This model prevents governance stagnation while preserving constitutional authority.

---

## 2. Constitutional Authority

This policy derives authority from:
- **GOVERNANCE_PURPOSE_AND_SCOPE.md** - Governance as canonical memory
- **LEARNING_INTAKE_AND_PROMOTION_MODEL.md** - Learning promotion mandate
- **FAILURE_PROMOTION_RULE.md** - Failure pattern handling
- **VERSIONING_AND_EVOLUTION_GOVERNANCE.md** - Versioning principles
- **GOVERNANCE_COMPLETENESS_MODEL.md** - Completeness requirements
- **LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md** - Explicit layer-up (upward layering) mechanism (2026-02-09)
- **GOVERNANCE_ALIGNMENT_MONITORING_PROTOCOL.md** - Alignment monitoring and drift detection (2026-02-09)
- **ECOSYSTEM_VOCABULARY.md v1.1.0** - Canonical definitions of layering and rippling (2026-02-21)
- **LAYERING_AND_RIPPLING_AUTOMATION_STRATEGY.md** - Automation strategy for layering and rippling (2026-02-21)

---

## 3. Core Principles

### 3.1 Bidirectional Layering

Governance must support evolution in **both directions** (cross-repository):

**Downward Layering**: Governance → Consumer Repositories
- New governance rules layer down to all governed repos
- Schema updates layer down to all consumers
- Policy changes layer down to all enforcers
- Gate requirements layer down to all builders
- **Mechanism**: Layer-down issues created in consumer repos with artifact bundles

**Upward Layering**: Consumer Repositories → Governance
- Failure patterns layer up to governance
- Lessons learned layer up to governance
- Enforcement insights layer up to governance
- Practical constraints layer up to governance
- Governance drift escalates to governance
- Governance gaps trigger canon improvements
- **Mechanism**: Layer-up issues created in governance repo with evidence packages

Both directions are **mandatory and continuous**.

**Layer-Up Protocol**: See **LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md** for explicit, controlled mechanism for propagating learnings from application repositories back to canonical governance. Layer-up is **mandatory** before any canon changes to detect drift and gather alignment feedback.

### 3.2 Rippling (Within-Repository Integration)

After artifacts are layered down to a consumer repository, **rippling** integrates them within that repository:

**Rippling includes**:
- LOCKED section synchronization in agent contracts
- Cross-reference updates to versioned canon files
- Template synchronization from governance templates
- Schema reference updates
- GOVERNANCE_ALIGNMENT_INVENTORY.json updates
- Contract alignment (rare, requires CS2 approval)

**Rippling scope**: Single repository only. Rippling does NOT trigger cross-repository propagation.

**Rippling automation**: See **LAYERING_AND_RIPPLING_AUTOMATION_STRATEGY.md** for automation boundaries, escalation requirements, and CS2 approval gates.

### 3.3 Evolution Without Weakening

Governance evolution must:
- ✅ Improve clarity and enforceability
- ✅ Add missing rules discovered through practice
- ✅ Remove ambiguity and conflicts
- ✅ Adapt to new contexts and requirements

Governance evolution must NOT:
- ❌ Weaken existing enforcement
- ❌ Create loopholes
- ❌ Reduce auditability
- ❌ Compromise constitutional principles

**Governance evolves to become stronger, never weaker.**

### 3.4 Non-Blocking Evolution

Governance evolution must:
- ✅ Be versioned and explicit
- ✅ Provide transition periods when appropriate
- ✅ Preserve compliant historical state
- ✅ Remain auditable across versions

Governance evolution must NOT:
- ❌ Retroactively invalidate compliant history
- ❌ Create breaking changes without migration paths
- ❌ Stall delivery unnecessarily
- ❌ Create uncertainty about current requirements

**Static governance is prohibited. Blocking governance is prohibited.**

### 3.5 Authority Hierarchy Preserved

Governance evolution must respect:
1. Johan (Human Owner) - Ultimate authority
2. GOVERNANCE_PURPOSE_AND_SCOPE.md - Constitutional canon
3. Canonical governance policies - Subordinate canon
4. Repository practices - Implementation layer

**Higher authority always prevails during evolution.**

---

## 4. Downward Layering (Governance → Consumer Repositories)

**Note**: This section describes **cross-repository distribution** of governance artifacts (layering down), not within-repository integration (rippling).

### 4.1 What Layers Down

When governance changes, these artifacts must layer down to consumer repositories:

**Canon Updates**:
- New governance rules
- Updated governance policies
- Clarified governance principles
- New governance models

**Schema Updates**:
- New schemas
- Updated schema versions
- New required fields
- Deprecated fields

**Gate Updates**:
- New gate requirements
- Updated gate rules
- New enforcement mechanisms
- Updated failure classifications

**Agent Contract Updates**:
- New agent responsibilities
- Updated agent boundaries
- New separation-of-duties rules
- Updated orchestration models

### 4.2 Layer-Down Mechanisms

**Current Mechanisms** (semi-automated):
1. Governance change committed to governance repo
2. `.github/workflows/governance-ripple-dispatch.yml` triggers on main branch push
3. Workflow reads `CONSUMER_REPO_REGISTRY.json` for enabled consumers
4. Workflow dispatches GitHub repository events to consumer repos
5. Consumer repos receive events and governance-liaisons act on them

**Target Mechanisms** (per LAYERING_AND_RIPPLING_AUTOMATION_STRATEGY.md):
1. Governance change triggers layer-down workflow
2. All enabled consumer repositories receive GitHub issues with:
   - Changed artifact list
   - Version information
   - Integration instructions
   - Rippling protocol reference
3. Governance-liaisons execute rippling within their repos
4. Completion tracked via issue closure

### 4.3 Layer-Down Requirements

Every downward layer-down must:
- ✅ Be versioned explicitly
- ✅ Include change rationale
- ✅ Provide migration guidance (if breaking)
- ✅ Define effective date
- ✅ Document affected repositories
- ✅ Include validation criteria
- ✅ Maintain audit trail
- ✅ **Update governance inventory files** (central `CANON_INVENTORY.json` and consumer `GOVERNANCE_ALIGNMENT_INVENTORY.json`)
- ✅ **Validate inventory coverage** post-propagation using `scripts/sync_repo_inventory.py`

**Inventory Maintenance**: Per `governance/runbooks/GOVERNANCE_INVENTORY_MAINTENANCE.md`, all canon creation, modification, or layer-down events MUST trigger inventory updates to maintain alignment tracking across central and consumer repositories.

### 4.4 Breaking vs Non-Breaking Changes

**Non-Breaking Changes** (immediate layer-down):
- Additive schema fields (optional)
- New governance clarifications
- Additional enforcement (not stricter)
- Documentation improvements

**Breaking Changes** (managed layer-down):
- Required schema field changes
- Stricter enforcement rules
- Removed capabilities
- Changed invariants

**Breaking changes require**:
- Version increment
- Migration period
- Backward compatibility (when possible)
- Explicit approval from Johan

---

## 5. Upward Layering (Consumer Repositories → Governance)

**Note**: This section describes **cross-repository feedback** of learnings and improvements (layering up), not within-repository integration (rippling).

### 5.1 What Layers Up

Consumer repositories generate insights that must layer up to governance:

**Failure Patterns**:
- Repeated gate failures for same cause
- Systematic builder confusion
- Ambiguous governance interpretation
- Enforcement inconsistencies

**Lessons Learned**:
- Missing governance rules discovered
- Unenforced invariants identified
- Practical constraints encountered
- Successful workarounds validated

**Enforcement Insights**:
- Gate mispredictions
- Schema inadequacies
- Policy ambiguities
- Agent boundary violations

**Structural Mismatches**:
- Governance-reality divergence
- Unmaintainable requirements
- Conflicting rules
- Context-specific needs

### 5.2 Layer-Up Triggers

Upward layering is **mandatory** when:

**Governance Gaps**:
- A PR gate failure reveals missing governance rule
- GPCA misprediction occurs
- Gate and governance documentation diverge
- Agent unable to determine correct action

**Repeated Failures**:
- Same failure type occurs ≥3 times
- Same governance question asked ≥3 times
- Same escalation path taken ≥3 times
- Pattern indicates systematic issue

**Learning Qualification**:
- Lesson learned affects multiple repositories
- Lesson learned affects future builds
- Lesson learned requires governance update
- Lesson learned reveals missing invariant

**Constitutional Violations**:
- One-Time Build Law violated due to governance gap
- Separation of duties unclear
- Authority hierarchy ambiguous
- Evidence trail incomplete

### 5.3 Layer-Up Mechanisms

**Layer-Up Protocol** (systematic, via **LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md**):
1. **Detection**: Application repository identifies trigger (gap, drift, failure pattern, etc.)
2. **Documentation**: governance-liaison/foreman creates layer-up issue with evidence
3. **Escalation**: Issue created in governance repository with `layer-up` label
4. **Intake**: governance-repo-administrator validates and classifies (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
5. **Analysis**: governance-repo-administrator drafts governance change with evidence package
6. **Review**: CS2 (Johan) approves or requests changes
7. **Integration**: Governance PR merged, originating layer-up marked INTEGRATED
8. **Layer-Down Back**: Layer-down triggered to propagate improvement to all consumer repositories

**Pre-Canon-Change Layer-Up Scan** (mandatory, via **LAYER_UP_PROTOCOL.md** Section 9.1):
- Before ANY canon changes, governance-repo-administrator MUST scan consumer repositories
- Detect drift, pending layer-up issues, alignment gaps
- Resolve detected issues BEFORE proceeding with new canon changes
- Prevents circular drift and governance-application misalignment

**Future Mechanism** (semi-automated):
1. Repository records failure/learning per schema
2. Automated analysis identifies patterns
3. Layer-up recommendation generated
4. FM or Governance Administrator reviews
5. If approved, governance PR auto-created
6. Human review and approval (CS2 for constitutional changes)
7. Governance updated and layered down

### 5.4 Layer-Up Schema

Upward layering must use structured schema:

**Schema Location**: `governance/schemas/GOVERNANCE_CHANGE_PROPOSAL.schema.md`

**Required Content**:
- Layer-up trigger (failure pattern, lesson learned, etc.)
- Evidence (failure records, PR links, etc.)
- Proposed governance change
- Impact analysis
- Affected repositories
- Migration plan (if breaking)
- Rationale and justification
