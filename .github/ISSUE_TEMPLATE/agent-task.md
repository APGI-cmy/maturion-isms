> ⚠️ **MANDATORY AGENT PREFLIGHT — DO NOT SKIP — READ BEFORE PROCEEDING**
>
> Before reading anything below this banner, the assigned agent MUST:
>
> 1. **Call `agent_bootstrap` FIRST** — this is your required first tool call, before reading
>    any file or this issue body:
>    ```
>    agent_bootstrap(agent_id: "<your-agent-id>")
>    ```
>    Determine your `agent_id` from the assignee field or issue title.
>    The tool returns your full contract file. Read it in full before proceeding.
>
> 2. **Complete Phase 1 IN FULL** and produce declared output for every step.
>
> 3. **Record Phase 1 evidence** in your session memory file at
>    `.agent-workspace/<agent-id>/memory/session-NNN-YYYYMMDD.md`
>
> **Failure to call `agent_bootstrap` first is a POLC breach —
> GOV-BREACH-AIMC-W5-002 — and will cause your PR to be blocked by the CI preflight gate.**
>
> **Authority**: CS2 (Johan Ras / @APGI-cmy)
