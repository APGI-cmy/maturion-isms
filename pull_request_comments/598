## CS2 — Session Cross-Contamination Notice & CS2 Manual Promotion to Ready

**Documented by**: CS2 (@APGI-cmy) via Copilot review

### What Happened

The foreman-v2-agent session-059 that produced this PR suffered a **session context cross-contamination** at Phase 2. The PR body records:

> `Switched to branch copilot/integrate-mat-with-aimc`
> `CI failure confirmed locally: src/components/common/aiAssistantConfig.ts:17 — VITE_AI_GATEWAY_URL not declared in ImportMetaEnv`

These observations belong to **PR #589 (Wave 7)**, not this PR. The foreman loaded the wrong wave context during Phase 2, which caused Phases 3 and 4 checklist items to remain unchecked — the session diagnosed a Wave 7 TypeScript error that is irrelevant to Wave 9.1-FU.

Despite this session confusion, the **actual branch deliverables are complete and correct**:
- All 4 code files committed to `copilot/add-arc-redaction-support` ✅
- PREHANDOVER proof (session-059) present ✅
- IAA session-008 present ✅
- IAA audit token `IAA-WAVE9.1-FU-20260226-PASS` issued ✅
- `mergeable_state: clean` ✅

The cross-contamination was a session-state error only — it did not corrupt the branch content.

### CS2 Manual Promotion — Authorisation on Record

The OPOJD gate is satisfied by evidence already on the branch. CS2 hereby manually authorises promotion of this PR to **Ready for Review** and records this comment as the Phase 4 closure authority in lieu of foreman completing its checklist.

**IAA token confirmed**: `IAA-WAVE9.1-FU-20260226-PASS`

### Learning Recorded — Governance Improvement

> **LEARNING-WAVE9.1-FU-001**: When `foreman-v2-agent` is invoked against an issue while a different wave's branch is already active in the coding agent environment, it may latch onto the wrong branch context during Phase 2. Mitigation: foreman contract should explicitly verify that the current branch matches the triggering issue's expected branch name before proceeding past Phase 2. If mismatch is detected, halt and escalate to CS2 rather than proceeding with incorrect context.
