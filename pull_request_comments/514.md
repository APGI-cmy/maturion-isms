@Copilot — **CS2 Instruction: Pre-Handover Merge Gate Parity Fix + Learning Record**

## Context — Canon Incoming

A canon update is in progress (see `APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance#1201`) that will formally require a **mandatory local merge gate parity check** before any PR handover. The canon will enforce: run every check in `merge_gate_interface.required_checks` locally, produce a PASS/FAIL result for each, and STOP+FIX before opening a PR if any check fails.

**You should treat this as already in effect.** Run a duplicate (local pre-handover) test now against all three merge gate checks before this PR is considered ready for CS2 review.

## Immediate Fix Required — Failing Job 64703977203

The `Merge Gate Interface` workflow failed. The confirmed root cause is **invalid JSON syntax in `governance/sync_state.json`**.

Workflow log evidence:
```
sync_state.json exists.
sync_state.json has invalid JSON syntax.
Process exited with code 1.
```

### Steps to Fix

1. Open `governance/sync_state.json` on branch `copilot/create-independent-assurance-agent-file`
2. Validate the JSON — common causes:
   - Trailing comma on the last item in an object or array
   - Comments (`//` or `/* */`) — JSON does not support comments
   - Missing or mismatched `{}` / `[]`
   - Unquoted keys or values
3. Apply the fix. Example:

**Invalid (before):**
```json
{
  "key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2",
}
```

**Valid (after):**
```json
{
  "key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2"
}
```

4. Also check `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` for the same class of issue while you have the file open.
5. Push the corrected file to your branch.
6. Re-run the `Merge Gate Interface` workflow and confirm all three checks pass:
   - `Merge Gate Interface / merge-gate/verdict`
   - `Merge Gate Interface / governance/alignment`
   - `Merge Gate Interface / stop-and-fix/enforcement`

## Learning Artifact to Record

Record the following in your **session memory** (`session-026-20260224.md`) and **parking station** (`suggestions-log.md`):

**Session memory addition:**
```
escalations_triggered: none
learning: Merge gate failed (job 64703977203) due to invalid JSON syntax in governance/sync_state.json.
  Root cause: trailing comma / comment in JSON file.
  Fix: validated and corrected JSON before re-push.
  Prevention: always validate governance JSON files locally before handover. Canon update incoming
  (maturion-foreman-governance#1201) will formalise this as a mandatory pre-handover parity check.
```

**Parking station entry:**
```
| 2026-02-24 | independent-assurance-agent (session-026) | SESSION-END | Merge gate failed on invalid sync_state.json JSON syntax — canon update #1201 incoming to enforce local parity checks pre-handover. | session-026-20260224.md |
```

**Do NOT merge.** Awaiting CS2 approval after all three merge gate checks pass.
