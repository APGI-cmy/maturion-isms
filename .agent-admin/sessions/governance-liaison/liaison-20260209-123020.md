# governance-liaison Session Contract
**Session ID**: liaison-20260209-123020
**Started**: 2026-02-09T12:30:20+00:00
**Repository**: APGI-cmy/maturion-isms

## This Session Mission
Produce comprehensive ISMS governance gap analysis and batched alignment plan for phased execution.

Requirements:
- Scan entire ISMS governance repository
- Identify all governance gaps (missing canons, broken locked sections, references, version drift, etc.)
- Assess risk for each gap
- Recommend batching strategy
- Specify files, dependencies, validation, rollback for each batch
- Attest to governance alignment readiness

## Governance Context
- Local TIER_0 Canon: unknown
- Canonical Source: APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance
- Self-Alignment: Authorized

## Governance Health Check Results

### Drift Detection
- TIER_0 Manifest: [ALIGNED | DRIFT DETECTED]
- Canon Files: [COUNT] checked, [DRIFT_COUNT] with drift
- Pending Canon Files: [PENDING_COUNT] tracked
- Governance Escalations: [ESCALATION_COUNT] unresolved

### Evidence Collected
- Evidence Log: .agent-admin/sessions/governance-liaison/liaison-20260209-123020_evidence.log

## Alignment Actions Log

### Files Successfully Layered Down (2/22 - 9%)
- Layered down: BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md (35,004 bytes, SHA256: 0a95b7c6...)
- Layered down: governance/canon/CONSTITUTIONAL_SANDBOX_PATTERN.md (21,095 bytes, SHA256: 25e88a80...)

### Critical Discovery: Canonical Repository Incomplete
- Scanned: 22 governance files referenced by agent contracts
- Found Available: 2 files (9%)
- Found Missing from Canonical: 20 files (91%)
- Impact: All agents non-functional (80-90% governance references missing)

### Deliverables Created
1. ISMS_GOVERNANCE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md - Comprehensive 23-file gap analysis with 7-batch plan
2. GOVERNANCE_ALIGNMENT_STATUS.md - Critical escalation report on canonical gap
3. Session evidence logs and alignment trail

## Pre-Handover Validation
- [x] Governance alignment verified (PARTIAL - 2/22 files only)
- [x] Blocking drift detected (CRITICAL - canonical incomplete)
- [x] Pending canon files tracked (20 files unavailable in canonical)
- [x] Evidence collected and logged
- [x] Session contract complete

## Outcome

**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL COMPLETION - CRITICAL ESCALATION REQUIRED

### Completed Successfully
✅ Comprehensive governance gap analysis (23 files identified)
✅ Canonical availability scan (discovered 91% canonical gap)
✅ Partial alignment (2/2 available files layered down)
✅ Critical finding documented and escalated
✅ 7-batch alignment plan created (executable when canonical complete)

### Blocked - Requires CS2 Action
❌ Full governance alignment (20/22 files unavailable in canonical)
❌ Agent operational readiness (all agents 80-90% governance missing)
❌ TIER_0_CANON_MANIFEST.json (missing from canonical)
❌ Complete ISMS governance coverage (only 9% achieved)

### Critical Escalation
🚨 **Canonical governance repository (APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance) is 91% incomplete**
🚨 Only 2 of 22 expected governance files exist in canonical source
🚨 All agent contracts reference non-existent governance files
🚨 Entire governance system non-functional until canonical populated

### Governance Aligned (Partial)
- Local TIER_0 Canon: NOT AVAILABLE (missing from canonical)
- Canonical TIER_0 Canon: NOT AVAILABLE
- Drift: MASSIVE CANONICAL GAP (20/22 files missing from source)
- Files Layered Down: 2/22 (9% coverage)

### Session Memory
- Repository: APGI-cmy/maturion-isms
- Files layered down: 2 (BUILD_PHILOSOPHY.md, CONSTITUTIONAL_SANDBOX_PATTERN.md)
- Files blocked: 20 (missing from canonical source)
- Next action: CS2 must populate canonical governance repository
- Ripple source: N/A (canonical incomplete)
- Next sync: After CS2 populates canonical (manual trigger required)

### Deliverables
1. **ISMS_GOVERNANCE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md** - 820+ line comprehensive gap analysis
   - 23 missing files identified and categorized
   - Risk assessment (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - 7-batch alignment plan with dependencies, validation, rollback
   - Timeline: ~95 minutes total (when canonical available)

2. **GOVERNANCE_ALIGNMENT_STATUS.md** - Critical escalation report
   - Canonical repository 91% incomplete (20/22 files missing)
   - Agent operational readiness: 0% (all agents blocked)
   - Governance coverage: 9% (2/22 files)
   - Root cause analysis and recommended actions
   - CS2 escalation required

3. **Session Evidence Trail**
   - Evidence log: 5+ entries
   - Alignment log: Partial layer-down actions documented
   - Canonical scan results: 22 files tested, 20 returned HTTP 404

### Recommendations for CS2
1. **URGENT**: Populate canonical governance repository (20 missing files)
2. **VALIDATE**: Agent contract governance.bindings paths match canonical structure
3. **ESTABLISH**: Governance ripple from canonical to consumer repos
4. **ENABLE**: governance-liaison to execute full alignment after canonical complete

**Session Authority**: governance-liaison self-alignment (Issue #999)  
**Classification**: CRITICAL ESCALATION  
**Timestamp**: 2026-02-09T12:30:00Z - 2026-02-09T12:45:00Z
