# governance-liaison Session Contract
**Session ID**: liaison-20260211-133720
**Started**: 2026-02-11T13:37:20+00:00
**Completed**: 2026-02-11T13:42:00+00:00

## This Session Mission
**Trigger**: Firewall removal - full canonical repository access restored

**Objective**: 
Complete full governance alignment after firewall limitations were removed. Previous sessions had partial access to canonical repository. Now with full access, execute comprehensive layer-down of all PUBLIC_API governance canon files.

## Governance Context
- Local TIER_0 Canon: N/A (canonical uses CANON_INVENTORY.json, not TIER_0_CANON_MANIFEST.json)
- Canonical Source: APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance
- Canonical CANON_INVENTORY Version: 1.0.0
- Self-Alignment: Authorized
- Firewall Status: REMOVED - Full canonical access restored

## Governance Health Check Results

### Initial State Assessment
- TIER_0 Manifest: N/A (canonical uses CANON_INVENTORY.json)
- Local Canon Files: ~90 files present (from previous partial layer-downs)
- Canonical PUBLIC_API Canons: 102 files
- Gap Identified: Missing approximately 12 PUBLIC_API canon files
- Pending Canon Files: 3 tracked (FM_ROLE_CANON.md, WAVE_MODEL.md, LIVING_AGENT_SYSTEM.md)
- Governance Escalations: 0 unresolved

### Firewall Removal Verification
- Previous Session: Experienced HTTP 404 errors when fetching TIER_0_CANON_MANIFEST.json
- Current Session: Successfully accessed CANON_INVENTORY.json via GitHub API
- Canonical Repository: Fully accessible via HTTPS and GitHub API
- Network Status: All connections to canonical repository successful

### Evidence Collected
- Evidence Log: `.agent-admin/sessions/governance-liaison/liaison-20260211-133720_evidence.log`
- Drift Detection: Local governance incomplete, canonical fully accessible
- Canonical Inventory: v1.0.0 with 135 total canons (102 PUBLIC_API)
- Wake-up Protocol: Confirmed no TIER_0 manifest exists, CANON_INVENTORY.json is correct

## Full Alignment Execution

### Step 1: Canonical Inventory Fetch
- Fetched: `governance/CANON_INVENTORY.json` from canonical repository
- Version: 1.0.0
- Total Canons: 135
- PUBLIC_API Canons: 102
- Last Updated: 2026-02-11
- Status: ✅ SUCCESS

### Step 2: PUBLIC_API Canon Layer-Down
- Method: Parsed CANON_INVENTORY.json for all `layer_down_status=="PUBLIC_API"` items
- Total Files Processed: 102
- Successfully Layered Down: 102
- Skipped (empty): 0
- Failed: 0
- Success Rate: 100%

**Layer-Down Details**:
- All files downloaded from: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APGI-cmy/maturion-foreman-governance/main/`
- Each file verified with SHA256 checksum
- File sizes range from 397 bytes to 155,708 bytes
- Total governance downloaded: ~2.5 MB

### Step 3: Inventory Update
- Updated: `GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md`
- Session ID updated to: liaison-20260211-133720
- Last Updated timestamp: 2026-02-11T13:39:00+00:00
- Alignment Status: FULLY ALIGNED
- Evidence logs updated with new session references

## Alignment Actions Log

### Canon Files Layered Down (102 total)
All PUBLIC_API canon files successfully layered down with SHA256 verification. See `.agent-admin/sessions/governance-liaison/liaison-20260211-133720_alignment.log` for complete file-by-file list with checksums.

**Key Governance Artifacts**:
- Agent governance: 13 files (contracts, recruitment, ripple awareness, etc.)
- Build governance: 9 files (execution model, intervention, tree execution, etc.)
- Merge gate governance: 8 files (philosophy, protocols, applicability, etc.)
- Commissioning governance: 5 files (evidence, initialization, activation, etc.)
- Repository governance: 7 files (initialization, layer-down, ripple, etc.)
- Quality governance: 6 files (QA policy, test removal, combined testing, etc.)
- Domain governance: 5 files (ownership, evolution, state enforcement, etc.)
- Cross-repository: 4 files (layer-down, ripple awareness, ripple transport, etc.)
- Policy files: 9 files (FM delegated action, builder handover, test traceability, etc.)
- Coordination: 1 file (CROSS_AGENT_COORDINATION_PROTOCOL.md)
- OPOJD: 1 file (OPOJD_COMPLETE_JOB_HANDOVER_DOCTRINE.md)
- Agent doctrine: 1 file (AGENT_IGNORANCE_PROHIBITION_DOCTRINE.md)
- Remaining: 33 additional canon files covering various governance aspects

### Validation
- Manual count verification: 102 files successfully written to disk
- SHA256 checksums: All 102 files checksummed and logged
- Directory structure: All subdirectories created as needed
- No validation script available (expected for governance documents)

## Pre-Handover Validation (Final)
- [x] Governance alignment verified (100% PUBLIC_API canons present)
- [x] No blocking drift detected or drift resolved (full re-alignment completed)
- [x] Pending canon files tracked in evidence log (3 files still not in canonical)
- [x] Evidence collected and logged (complete alignment log with 102 file checksums)
- [x] Session contract complete
- [x] Firewall removal verified and canonical repository fully accessible
- [x] All 102 PUBLIC_API canon files layered down successfully

## Outcome

**Status**: COMPLETE

**Governance Fully Aligned**:
- Local CANON_INVENTORY: 1.0.0 (using correct canonical inventory naming)
- Canonical CANON_INVENTORY: 1.0.0
- Drift: NONE - Full alignment achieved
- Files aligned: 104 total (102 PUBLIC_API canons + 2 governance contracts from PR #1083)
- Success Rate: 100% (102/102 PUBLIC_API canons)

**Firewall Removal Impact**:
- ✅ Canonical repository now fully accessible
- ✅ All PUBLIC_API canon files successfully retrieved
- ✅ No connection failures or timeouts
- ✅ Full governance alignment achieved

**Comparison with Previous Sessions**:
- Session liaison-20260211-125313: Initial layer-down (partial, ~90 files)
- Session liaison-20260211-131419: PR #1083 contracts (2 files)
- Session liaison-20260211-133720: Full re-alignment (102 canon files) ← CURRENT

**Session Memory**:
- Files updated: 1 (GOVERNANCE_ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.md)
- Files created/refreshed: 102 (all PUBLIC_API canons)
- Ripple source: Full canonical CANON_INVENTORY.json v1.0.0
- Next sync due: On-demand or quarterly alignment check
- Evidence logs preserved:
  - `.agent-admin/sessions/governance-liaison/liaison-20260211-133720_evidence.log`
  - `.agent-admin/sessions/governance-liaison/liaison-20260211-133720_alignment.log`

**Key Findings**:
1. Canonical repository uses `CANON_INVENTORY.json` not `TIER_0_CANON_MANIFEST.json`
2. There are 135 total canons, 102 are PUBLIC_API (for layer-down)
3. 33 canons are marked as INTERNAL (remain in canonical repo only)
4. Previous sessions had incomplete layer-down due to firewall/access limitations
5. Full alignment now achieved with firewall removed
