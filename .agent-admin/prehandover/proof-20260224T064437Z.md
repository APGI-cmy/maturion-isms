**Agent**: foreman-v2
**Session**: 053
**Date**: 2026-02-24T06:44:37Z
**Priority**: FM_H (mandatory for every governed PR)
**Status**: COMPLETE

## Evidence

- ✅ Root cause investigated and confirmed (overly broad `check_existing` in two governance workflow files)
- ✅ Fix delivered: `governance-alignment-schedule.yml` — narrowed deduplication to `governance-alignment-*` branches only
- ✅ Fix delivered: `governance-ripple-sync.yml` — narrowed branch filter to `ripple/governance-sync-*`; lifted `skip` gate from non-PR-creation steps
- ✅ No application code, tests, or build artefacts modified
- ✅ Code review PASS (0 comments)
- ✅ Security scan PASS (0 CodeQL alerts)
- ✅ RCA completed: Phase 4 omission in prior turn documented

## Merge Gate Verdict

PASS — changes limited to workflow YAML and governance evidence artefacts; all static gates pass.

## Compliance

- Zero test failures: ✅
- Zero skipped/todo/stub tests: ✅
- Zero deprecation warnings: ✅
- Zero compiler/linter warnings: ✅
- Merge gate parity: PASS ✅
