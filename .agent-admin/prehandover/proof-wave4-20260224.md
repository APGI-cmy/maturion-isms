## CS2 Compliance Fixes Applied

- [x] PART 2 RCA: `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-wave4-cs2-compliance-RCA-20260224.md`
- [x] PART 3 FAIL-ONLY-ONCE: A-19, A-20, A-21 entries + INC-WAVE4-CS2-001 breach log row
- [x] FIX 1 (final): wave4-cst.test.ts header updated with CS2 PR comment reference — issuecomment-3950176995
- [x] Draft removal — CS2 confirmed, PR undrafted 2026-02-24
