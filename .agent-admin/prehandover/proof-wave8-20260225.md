## PREHANDOVER Checklist

- [x] **Scope matches frozen architecture** — Wave 8 deliverables per AAWP: RunwayAdapter (video-generation), OpenAIAdapter ALGORITHM_EXECUTION (o3), wave8-cst.test.ts, contract test update, governance certification
- [x] **All 85 tests GREEN** — 17 test files, 85 tests, zero failures
- [x] **Zero test debt** — no `.skip()`, `.todo()`, or commented-out test bodies
- [x] **All merge gates satisfied** — see gate parity check below
- [x] **Evidence artifacts generated** — this proof + session memory + governance certification
- [x] **Session memory written** — `.agent-workspace/foreman-v2/memory/session-057-20260225.md`
- [x] **Parking station updated** — suggestion appended
- [x] **IAA invocation** — PHASE_A_ADVISORY (IAA not yet deployed)
- [x] **GRS-015 compliance** — no API key hardcoded (certified in AIMC_GOVERNANCE_CERTIFICATION.md)
- [x] **GRS-012 compliance** — telemetry written for VIDEO_GENERATION (certified in AIMC_GOVERNANCE_CERTIFICATION.md)
